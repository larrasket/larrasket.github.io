I like obtaining security and privacy on the services that I use, and I always
favor those being a design rather than trust, so I prefer to have the server I&rsquo;m
using <i>can not</i> see my texts or chats by design rather than by trusting their
claimed policies.

<h2 id="org12cdc24">Why Even Bother?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org12cdc24">
<p>
I have encountered numerous instances where individuals perceive my preference
for utilizing private and encrypted means of communication (E2EE) as suspicious.
Some even question the rationale behind such measures, expressing a lack of
concern regarding their own chat privacy. However, both of these assertions are
fundamentally flawed, as privacy holds inherent value for everyone. Consider the
unsettling scenario of one&rsquo;s conversations being leaked or the prospect of
someone having unrestricted access to your entire chat history with any
individual (which already applies if you are using any of the means that labeled
with <b>low</b> above.). The implications are undeniably disconcerting. It is
imperative to recognize the essentiality of privacy, even if its significance
may not be immediately apparent.
</p>

<p>
The notion that having &ldquo;nothing important to worry about&rdquo; implies a fulfilling
existence is a misguided perspective. This mindset reflects a certain hollowness
within one&rsquo;s life that warrants introspection and addressing. Rather than solely
contemplating the importance of private communication, it would be better to
focus on nurturing a more meaningful and purposeful existence rather than
communication means if you have such claims like &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to worry about on
my chats&rdquo;. If one&rsquo;s communications lack any substance worth safeguarding, it may
indicate a lack of genuine connections or a failure to engage in authentic
experiences, which merits attention and cultivation.
