I wrote about the <a href="d/porn.html#yh5juz019wj0">Industry and Consumption of Pornography</a> a while ago. Today I
learnt that Baudrillard has a related theory<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Frederic Lenoir, <i>Philosophy of desire</i> (Dar Al Saqi, 2023), 45.</span> that reminded me of the Social Learning theory in the sociobiological theories of rape:
</p>
<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Jean Baudrillard wrote the following maxim: &ldquo;Sexuality does not hide in
tolerance, repression, or morality, it is certainly hidden in what is more
sexual than sex itself: pornography.&rdquo; In Baudrillard&rsquo;s view, the global success
of pornography is not a result of sexual liberation but rather the triumph of
capitalism, which turns everything into a commodity, including bodies that lose
their ability to enjoy and experience desire.
</p>

<p>
Hans Blüher continued where Baudrillard’s works left off and tried to show that
the transition from sexual desire to pornography marks the boundary of the
&ldquo;unforgivable violation&rdquo; with absolute permission—driven immediately by the urge
to fulfill expectations and fantasies. This, he claims, signals the end of
otherness in sexual and romantic relationships. The body of the other is
consumed and discarded as if it were a consumable and disposable object. The
desire for the other becomes a desire for oneself alone.
</p>

<p>
We now strive for comfort, safety, and ease in the field of unity and isolation.
Today’s love is free of all excess and all sin (&#x2026;). Eros aims for the other in
an emotional sense, yet does not allow itself to recover in the system of the
self. In this identical, increasingly homogeneous society, contradictions no
longer exist, and hence no erotic experience. This assumes a state of both
internal and external dissonance.

I found an interesting piece by Leo Tolstoy:
<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/tolstoy/1900/slavery-of-our-times.html">https://www.marxists.org/archive/tolstoy/1900/slavery-of-our-times.html</a> on wage
labor:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Slavery exists in full vigor, but we do not perceive it, just as in Europe at
the end of the Eighteenth Century the slavery of serfdom was not perceived.
People of that day thought that the position of men obliged to till the land for
their lords, and to obey them, was a natural, inevitable, economic condition of
life, and they did not call it slavery.  It is the same among us: people of our
day consider the position of the laborer to be a natural, inevitable economic
condition, and they do not call it slavery. And as, at the end of the Eighteenth
Century, the people of Europe began little by little to understand that what
formerly seemed a natural and inevitable form of economic life-namely, the
position of peasants who were completely in the power of their lords-was wrong,
unjust and immoral, and demanded alteration, so now people today are beginning
to understand that the position of hired workmen, and of the working classes in
general, which formerly seemed quite right and quite normal, is not what it
should be, and demands alteration.

القصيدة دي لها مكان خاص عندي، من أول مرة قرأتها وحسيت بخصوصية لها وبؤلفه شديدة:
المتنبي متثبت بخيط أمل رفيع للغاية (علاقته بأبي شجاع فاتك، ومُنياه في انقلابه على
كافور الإخشيدي)، بيبدأها بإنه يبث فَقره: لا خيل عندك. ومعه هدفه من الغنى:
&ldquo;تُهديها&rdquo;، أي الجود وليس المال لأجل الرفاه. حُزنه المستمر على بقاء نيته محل النية:
&ldquo;وَإِن تَكُن مُحكَماتُ الشُكلِ تَمنَعُني&rdquo; وقدرته فقط على البوح بها دون إنفاذها: &ldquo;فَلي فيهِنَّ
تَصهالُ&rdquo; تذكيره لنفسه بأمل مشقته ومعاناته في الحياة: لَولا المَشَقَّةُ سادَ الناسُ كُلُّهُمُ
<code>...</code> الجودُ يُفقِرُ وَالإِقدامُ قَتّالُ، وأخيرًا تسليمه بأنه وُلد في غير زمانه<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

</span>: ذِكرُ
الفَتى عُمرُهُ الثاني وَحاجَتُهُ ما قاتَهُ وَفُضولُ العَيشِ أَشغالُ. عَرفت فيما بعد أن المتنبي
كتب هذه القصيدة عندما كان يقطن نفس المدينة التي أقطنها حاليًا، ويا لها من صدفة.
مات أمل أبو الطيب المتنبي (أبو شجاع فاتك) بعد شهور قليلة من القصيدة، وماتت بعده
أمال المتنبي الكثيرة، ومات معها فارسًا مقبلًا. طيب الله ثراه.

Nermeen&rsquo;s university sent her today a PDF file that was bundled inside an MS
windows executable (exe), she needed to run it outside of the Windows machine.
Upon extracting it, I found it was bundled as a Kotobee ebook, which turned to
be a DRM service to create &ldquo;interactive books&rdquo;. After doing a quick binary
analysis to ensure that we are indeed dealing with a DRM&rsquo;d exe file (and not
embarrassingly fdoc file renamed to be .exe), I managed to build a document out
of it. Here&rsquo;s the steps:
</p>

<p>
First of all, simply, extract the exe content:
</p>
<pre class="code"><code>unzip file.exe -d extracted_directory
</code></pre>

<p>
The extracted directory should have a similar tree to this:
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org604a158">
larrasket [~/tmp/rq/e]$ ls -l
total 152
-rw-r--r-- 1 l l   2227 Aug 21 14:42 config.js

From here it&rsquo;s very obvious that we can run this node app in a web server. You
can run a simple http server here:
</p>
<pre class="code"><code>python3 -m http.server <span style="color: #cd5c60;">9000</span>
</code></pre>
<p>
And the app will be available at port 9000. Alternatively you can build an epub
from the provided epub directory:
</p>

<p>
Inside the epub directory append the mimetype
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>zip -0X <span style="color: #6fb593;">"../book.epub"</span> mimetype
zip -rDX9 <span style="color: #6fb593;">"../book.epub"</span> * -x <span style="color: #6fb593;">"*.DS_Store"</span> -x mimetype
</code></pre>

<p>
This will get you the epub. Right after, you can convert it to pdf with
<code>epub-tools</code>:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>ebook-convert ../book.epub ../book.pdf
</code></pre>

<p>
As a single command:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #6bd9db;">(</span>zip -0X <span style="color: #6fb593;">"../book.epub"</span> mimetype &amp;&amp; <span style="color: #6fb593;">\\</span>

<span style="color: #31b1351b37b1;"> </span>   <span style="color: #31b1351b37b1;"> </span>   &amp;&amp; ebook-convert ../book.epub ../book.pdf

It&rsquo;s been said we are in the age of pricing. <a href="p/commodity.html#4fb240m099k0">The Age of Commodity</a>. I had a lot of thoughts

of the potential illegality of his practice of giving $1 million each day to a randomly
selected swing-state voter who signed a petition for his super PAC that backs the
Republican presidential candidate. <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/bill-gates-not-10-wealthiest-billionaires-world-who-made-list#">^{1}</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/elections/bill-gates-future-forward-kamala-harris.html">^{2}</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#2bf3dcf3d788">^{3}</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/elon-musk-defends-1-million-petition-giveaway-federal-warning-rcna177377">^{4}</a> In Moldova, where last month it was

identified an additional $24 million also directed toward purchasing the votes of 20
percent of the entire electorate; violence erupted at polling stations across the country
of Georgia, where international observers warned of Russian “vote-buying” in its
parliamentary elections and whose president said that the elections&rsquo; results “cannot be
accepted” and should be opposed with protests in the streets; and police in Mozambique
shot and killed at least ten of the thousands of demonstrators marching against the ruling
party&rsquo;s claim that it had just won more than 70 percent of votes nationally. <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/moldova-uncovers-15-million-russian-backed-plot-to-influence-upcoming-elections-with-bribes-and-disinformation/">^{5}</a> <a href="https://kyivindependent.com/moscow-funneled-39-million-into-moldova-ahead-of-presidential-election-in-attempt-to-influence-results-moldovan-authorities-say/">^{6}</a>

favor of the incumbent, who later accused him of embezzling money from the treasury; the
Vietnamese parliament elected a military general to replace its president, who, while
being investigated for bribery, resigned from the presidential office he&rsquo;d taken over from
his predecessor, who himself had resigned after 539 of his subordinates were implicated in

I was reading Messiri&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rehlati al-fikriah&rdquo;, and he mentioned something very interesting
there about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Fussell">Paul Fussell</a>, the renowned literary historian, apparently he was one of his
PhD external examiners. But that&rsquo;s not the interesting thing, it is what he mentions about
him: being a homosexual pervert. I was shocked from the information that Messiri mentioned
about him, that I quickly jumped to Wikipedia searching for anything with the keyword
&ldquo;gay&rdquo;, &ldquo;homosexual&rdquo;, etc.. Nothing (surprisingly) was there, I started to think that
Messiri might have linked to some other Paul Fussel. I then tried to search Google with
keywords like &ldquo;homosexual&rdquo; &ldquo;Paul Fussel&rdquo;, still, nothing there. I was finally certain that
either Messiri is talking about someone else, or this information were discrete. Then I
read a post on HN that was talking about Kagi, a less screwed (suckless) search engine, it
quickly linked me to the information Messiri mentioned about Fussel (his wife article
about their relationship and how he would like to enter a room full of guests naked)

I don&rsquo;t frequently post here, or anywhere, unlike past times. Lately I explored one of my
friend&rsquo;s music library, he told me how it&rsquo;s extremely diverse, he was correct about it. I
later wondered if that has anything to do with a disorder that he suffers from, which
relates to his ear. I wonder if how his music changes has anything to do with how that
acoustic  disorder affect his music taste. I also wondered if there&rsquo;s anything about me
that affects my frequency of writing here. Sometimes it&rsquo;s fascinating —even if you
believe in free will— how unfree we might be. How we might have the wrong ideas because
the search engine chooses not to be helpful enough, or have different views due to a

FOOS restrictions are really harmful to the progress of software development. I advocate
for the freedom of software, but I really dislike the way that other adherents use that
freedom which usually conclude making the progress/development much slower. An average GNU
fanatic user would require people to use some free git hosting, would refuse to make
support for non-free systems, might discourage usage of non &ldquo;fully free&rdquo; licensed software
packages. All of this result in making the progress really slow (and I&rsquo;m not here talking
even about the FSF signture stuff in the PR I linked above). Take for example the usage of
a fully-free Git hosting, like codeforage and the whatnot, this is totally fine as in
concept, but practically many people are just used to Microsoft&rsquo;s github, many people (in
fact the majority of people) don&rsquo;t know how to use emails for patchs and issues (in the
case of other forges like sourcehut), and many people just won&rsquo;t be encouraged enough to
do any of this (or even register at a new forge other than github).

I really like Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&rsquo;s PDFs (<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/support/friends.html">preview here</a>), however, they do
not allow you to download it without a subscription. It&rsquo;s actually good enough for a
subscription if you compare it to the HTML. For someone like me, my HTML appetite can not
hold more than few long articles, SEP average entry is about ~50 pages or so, that&rsquo;s not a
long article even. Here&rsquo;s how I get their entries as nice PDFs without subscription,
simply save the article part of the HTML page into a file, and using <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a> run:

I&rsquo;d always prefer a Lisp. But ideally, Go wins (more at <a href="d/languages.html#jb9efrq00xj0">The Prefect Programming
Language</a>) by its unauthoritarian package manager and not using <a href="d/languages.html#x0z0fu11qxj0">exception
handling</a>. As aforementioned @ <a href="sh/Dec2023-Feb2024.html#gvdlay40j3k0">A thought about Clojure</a>, I think Clojure is the
modern day Lisp that works very good for interactive programming and rapid
development. But here&rsquo;s another killer feature of Go that roughly does not exist
elsewhere: the great STD. With Go, I can feel very comfortable writing a Go
application without the need of checking the internet for questions or 3rd-party
libraries, eventually I might need to, but if compared to any other tool I&rsquo;ve
ever used, it&rsquo;s amazing (back in the day when I used C# I&rsquo;d need a web browser
always running alongside to my IDE). I do not have internet connection those
days and while playing tracks I thought of building a simple CLI to handle my
audio tracks synchronization, I know how to do it without reinventing the wheel
in Go, with only using the STD, with Clojure, it&rsquo;s going to be unrapid developement.

Here&rsquo;s my consolation for a very big part of my life of which I remind myself
very frequently especially if I&rsquo;m suspecting the existence of stupidity around.
A solace that often comes to the forefront.
Let me establish something that is misconstrued usually, people think that
smart people tend to be evil much more than stupid people. Which is correct,
intelligent people would be indeed much more capable of doing harm (i.e. evil).
However, here&rsquo;s the thing about stupidity; evilness is highly subjective that a
stupid person does not have to be aware that he/she is seeking something achieved,
that he/she is harming or even doing anything at all to be &rsquo;evil&rsquo; to an intelligent
individual. I want to give you some example but لولا النفوس الضعيفة سريعة المرض،
سيئة الغرض I&rsquo;d skip on that. Anyway, let&rsquo;s get back to my point about where I
find my consolation about this kind of nefarious and base evilness: it bounces
back. Stupids, imbeciles and retards 99% of the times hurt themselves back,
making shitty life decisions or just of being irritating to others. Their
decisions, marred by imprudence, or merely their presence, vexatious to others,
invariably rebound upon them. &ldquo;Errare humanum est, sed in errare perseverare
diabolicum&rdquo;.

Found out that Clojure has <a href="cs/go.html#lvkhzyo02wj0">Go</a>-like channels.
<a href="https://clojure.org/guides/async_walkthrough">https://clojure.org/guides/async_walkthrough</a>, very promising to use it (as

<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-09-23 Fri 20:15]</span></span>: If you are an old reader (if such a thing exists) of
this blog, you should know about my old attempts of creating a stack-like
posting that works within my editing environment (Emacs) which has always
failed. I&rsquo;m very good at Elisp, suck at writing Elisp packages \*Sigh\* life
doesn&rsquo;t give everything. Anyway I thought that everything I need to implement
such a workflow, is only a program that appends an entity top of a
string, and I started to implement it as a separated program. However, while
doing it I recognized that <code>(org-caputre)</code> already does it, just needed a simple
custom configuration:
</p>
<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #6bd9db;">(</span><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> <span style="color: #968cc7;">+org-capture-journal-file</span> <span style="color: #6fb593;">"~/blog/content/stack.org"</span><span style="color: #6bd9db;">)</span>
<span style="color: #6bd9db;">(</span><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> <span style="color: #968cc7;">org-capture-templates</span>
      <span style="color: #80bcb6;">'</span><span style="color: #ab98b5;">(</span><span style="color: #5D8272;">(</span><span style="color: #6fb593;">"j"</span> <span style="color: #6fb593;">"Journal"</span> entry
           <span style="color: #807f96;">(</span>file+headline <span style="color: #968cc7;">+org-capture-journal-file</span> <span style="color: #6fb593;">"Posts"</span><span style="color: #807f96;">)</span>
           <span style="color: #6fb593;">"* %&lt;%A, %d %B %Y&gt;\n%?"</span>  <span style="color: #80bcb6;">:prepend</span> t<span style="color: #5D8272;">)</span><span style="color: #ab98b5;">)</span><span style="color: #6bd9db;">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>
I also found a predefined way of doing it that build a full hierarchy date for
the entity, but I decided to go simple this time.
</p>

<p>
<b>Cons;</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I&rsquo;ve to archive it myself, no pagination.</li>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2022-10-05 Wed 20:18]</span></span>: I figured out a workaround to archive, and I don&rsquo;t
think I really need tags. Everything works great.</li>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2024-02-15 Thu 20:19]</span></span>: I do not find this workflow very good as of now, I do
not think that archiving is necessary either. I wil try to think of something
else soon.</li>
