<b>New changes in the site</b> — I was informed recently via a friend that the font
 in this website doesn't look so good. I thought that he just didn't like Times
 New Romans the way I did but it turned out that MS Windows renders that font in
 a very bad way unlike in Linux and Android, OSX (the machines that I have
 access too). After playing with some css (mostly stealing, I still cannot
 write this shit) the website now uses Serif for wide screens (PCs) and Times
 for mobiles. I think I've disregarded this website development for a long
 period of time, I will try to put it alongside with my other side projects.
 There should be a higher potential in making use of the data used in building
 this site.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>

For some reason the media refuse to show people any content that could be
considered as 'violent' accordingly to their policies<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>. You never see
someone gets crucial physical hurt in media. Never. I believe this has a
critical bad effect on people who are not instituting a view of the world out of
what they are being indoctrinated in the media, and this false view of the world
(that's free of unthinkable incidents) tends to make them blunder badly in such
situations. I've personally seen some of the examples of the accidents that
media won't cover, both IRL and on some obscure websites; in both I've noticed
that most people are being shocked and freezed rather than leery and careful.
They freeze in surprise instead of trying to move quickly, take action and save
what could be saved. Being shocked in such a situation shouldn't be strange,
however getting hysterically freezed is. The reason of this common freeze is the
fragile state of mind of these people that media have instituted (review Liquid Modernity for further reading on this point), they never imagined or even
thought of such a thing to happen in their view of the world; this deep shock
which is reflected in their freeze is a manifestation of the collapse of their
awareness.

An idea that I've got to believe in recently, is the fact that our lives are not
impacted by anything more than our own choices. This would either sound very
trivial or inaccurate for some of you. The ones who would think of it as a
trivial assertion probably have not considered the possibility of being stuck at
uncontrollable circumstances, like being killed by an earthquake or whatever;
your choices have nothing to do with that. I believe that this is true, however
there is a lot of subjectivity when it comes to telling what is uncontrollable
to us; for example, one could have made the choice to ensure his invulnerability
against such a disaster. I've been disagreed with a lot when it comes to
choices, people always mention 'feasibilities', but I think of it as extra
choices to be put right, which indeed adds more 'complexity' when we see it in
our view; however when you look at it more abstractively; it's nothing but a
tree of choices, just like the one in the linked tree.<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>

If you are an old reader (if such a thing even exist) for this blog, you should know about
my old attempts of creating a stack-like posting that works within my editing environment
(emacs) which had always failed. I'm very good at elisp, suck at writing elisp
packages \*Sigh\* life doesn't give everything. Anyway I thought that everything I need to
implement such a workflow, is only a program that appends an entity in the top of a string,
and I started to implement it as a separated program. However, while doing it I recognized
that <code>(org-caputre)</code> already does it, just needed a simple custom configuration:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-elisp">(<span style="font-weight: bold;">setq</span> +org-capture-journal-file <span style="font-style: italic;">"~/blog/content/stack.org"</span>)
(<span style="font-weight: bold;">setq</span> org-capture-templates
      '((<span style="font-style: italic;">"j"</span> <span style="font-style: italic;">"Journal"</span> entry
           (file+headline +org-capture-journal-file <span style="font-style: italic;">"Posts"</span>)
           <span style="font-style: italic;">"* %&lt;%A, %d %B %Y&gt;\n%?"</span>  <span style="font-weight: bold;">:prepend</span> t)))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I also found a predefined way of doing it that build a full hierarchy date for the entity,
but I decided to go simple this time.
</p>

<p>
<b>Cons;</b>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I've to archive it myself, no pagination.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>05 Oct, 2022 Update</b>: I figured out a workaround to archive, and I don't think I really need tags. Everything
 works great.

Going off of from these cutting edges, the 'peak of choices' applies to our
lives (these which for the most don't get affected by uncontrollable sequnces)
as a matter of fact. Are you going to spend the next couple of hours watching
useless dopamine dumps on Youtube or browising some hard science papers raising
p your knowledge, purity and sublimity? It's your choice.
