<h2 id="orgd729ee6">Sequel, The Structured Query Language</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd729ee6">
<div class="PREVIEW" id="org54ae360">
<p>
IBM developed the original version of SQL, originally called Sequel, as part of the
System R project in the early 1970s. The Sequel language has evolved since then, and its
name has changed to SQL (Structured Query Language). Many products now support
the SQL language. SQL has clearly established itself as the standard relational database
language.
</p>

</div>


<p>
The SQL language has several parts:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Data-definition language (DDL)</b>. The SQL DDL provides commands for defining relation
schemas, deleting relations, and modifying relation schemas.</li>
<li><b>Data-manipulation language (DML)</b>. The SQL DML provides the ability to query information
from the database and to insert tuples into, delete tuples from, and modify tuples in the
database.</li>
<li><b>Integrity</b>. The SQL DDL includes commands for specifying integrity constraints that the
data stored in the database must satisfy. Updates that violate integrity constraints are
disallowed.</li>
<li><b>View definition.</b> The SQL DDL includes commands for destining views.</li>
<li><b>Transaction control.</b> SQL includes commands for specifying the beginning and end points of
transactions.</li>
<li><b>Embedded SQL and dynamic SQL.</b> Embedded and dynamic SQL define how SQL statements can be
embedded within general-purpose programming languages, such as C, C++, and Java.</li>
<li><b>Authorization.</b> The SQL DDL includes commands for specifying access rights to relations and views.</li>
</ul>


<p>
The set of relations in a database are specified using a data-definition language (DDL). The
SQL DDL allows specification of not only a set of relations, but also information about each
relation, including:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The schema for each relation.</li>
<li>The types of values associated with each attribute.</li>
<li>The integrity constraints.</li>
<li>The set of indices to be maintained for each relation.</li>
<li>The security and authorization information for each relation.</li>
<li>The physical storage structure of each relation on disk.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Before going through any SQL flavor, let us take a look at the thoery prerequisites.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org8d2c421" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org8d2c421">Set Theory</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8d2c421">
<p>
Set theory, which originated with the mathematician Georg Cantor, is one of the mathematical
branches on which the relational model is based. Cantor’s definition of a set follows:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
By a “set” we mean any collection M into a whole of definite, distinct objects m
(which are called the “elements” of M) of our perception or of our thought.
</p>

<p>
— <i>Joseph W. Dauben and Georg Cantor (Princeton University Press, 1990)</i>
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
Every word in the definition has a deep and crucial meaning. The definitions of a set and
set membership are axioms that are not supported by proofs. Each element belongs to a
universe, and either is or is not a member of the set.
</p>

<p>
Let’s start with the word whole in Cantor’s definition. A set should be considered a single
entity.  Your focus should be on the collection of objects as opposed to the individual
objects that make up the collection. Later on, when you write T-SQL queries against tables
in a database (such as a table of employees), you should think of the set of employees as a
whole rather than the individual employees. This might sound trivial and simple enough, but
apparently many programmers have difficulty adopting this way of thinking.
</p>


<p>
The word distinct means that every element of a set must be unique. Jumping ahead to tables
in a database, you can enforce the uniqueness of rows in a table by defining key
constraints. Without a key, you won’t be able to uniquely identify rows, and therefore the
table won’t qualify as a set. Rather, the table would be a multiset or a bag.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgea47323" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgea47323">Predicate Logic</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgea47323">
<p>
Predicate logic, is another branch of mathematics on which the relational model is based.
Dr. Edgar F. Codd, in creating the relational model, had the insight to connect predicate
logic to both management and querying of data. Loosely speaking, a predicate is a property
or an expression that either holds or doesn’t hold—in other words, is either true or false.
The relational model relies on predicates to maintain the logical integrity of the data and
define its structure. One example of a predicate used to enforce integrity is a constraint
defined in a table called Employees that allows only employees with a salary greater than
zero to be stored in the table. The predicate is “salary greater than zero” (T-SQL
expression: \(salary > 0\)).
</p>

<p>
In set theory, you can use predicates to define sets. This is helpful because you can’t
always define a set by listing all its elements (for example, infinite sets), and sometimes
for brevity it’s more convenient to define a set based on a property. As an example of an
infinite set defined with a predicate, the set of all prime numbers can be defined with the
following predicate: “x is a positive integer greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and
itself.” For any specified value, the predicate is either true or not true. The set of all
prime numbers is the set of all elements for which the predicate is true. As an example of a
finite set defined with a predicate, the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} can be defined
as the set of all elements for which the following predicate holds true: “x is an integer
greater than or equal to 0 and smaller than or equal to 9.”
</p>

<h4 id="org605fc30">Propositions, Predicates, and Relations</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org605fc30">
<p>
The common belief that the term relational stems from relationships between tables is
incorrect. “Relational” actually pertains to the mathematical term relation. In set theory,
a relation is a representation of a set. In the relational model, a relation is a set of
related information, with the counterpart in SQL being a table—albeit not an exact
counterpart. A key point in the relational model is that a single relation should represent
a single set (for example, Customers). It is interesting to note that operations on
relations (based on relational algebra) result in a relation (for example, a join between
two relations).
</p>

<p>
When you design a data model for a database, you represent all data with relations (tables).
You start by identifying propositions that you will need to represent in your database. A
proposition is an assertion or a statement that must be true or false. For example, the
statement, “Employee Itzik BenGan was born on February 12, 1971, and works in the IT
department” is a proposition. If this proposition is true, it will manifest itself as a row
in a table of Employees. A false proposition simply won’t manifest itself. This presumption
is known as the close world assumption (CWA).
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orge115862" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge115862">Basic Types</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge115862">
<p>
The SQL standard supports a variety of built-in types, including:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>char</code> \((n)\): A fixed-length character string with user-specified length <code>n</code>. The full form,
character, can be used instead.<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
SQL also provides the <code>nvarchar</code> type to store multilingual data using the Unicode
representation. However, many databases allow Unicode (in the UTF-8 representation) to be
stored even in varchar types.
</span></li>
<li><code>varchar</code> \((n)\): A variable-length character string with user-specified maximum length <code>n</code>. The
full form, character varying, is equivalent</li>
<li><code>int</code>: An integer (a finite subset of the integers that is machine dependent). The full
form, integer, is equivalent.</li>
<li><code>smallint</code>: A small integer (a machine-dependent subset of the integer type).</li>
<li><code>numeric</code> \((p, d)\): A fixed-point number with user-specified precision. The number consists of \(p\)
digits (plus a sign), and \(d\) of the \(p\) digits are to the right of the decimal point. Thus,
<code>numeric(3,1)</code> allows 44.5 to be stored exactly, but neither 444.5 nor 0.32 can be stored
exactly in a field of this type.</li>
<li><code>float(n)</code>: A floating-point number with precision of at least <code>n</code> digits.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each type may include a special value called the <code>null</code> value. A null value indicates an
absent value that may exist but be unknown or that may not exist at all. In certain cases,
we may wish to prohibit null values from being entered, as we shall see shortly.
</p>

<p>
You can understand the difference between <code>char</code> and <code>varchar</code> this way:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">Create</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">table</span> <span style="color: #80bcb6;">temp</span>
(City <span style="color: #cd9575;">CHAR</span>(<span style="color: #cd5c60;">10</span>),
Street <span style="color: #cd9575;">VARCHAR</span>(<span style="color: #cd5c60;">10</span>));

<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">Insert</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">into</span> temp
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">values</span>(<span style="color: #6fb593;">'Pune'</span>,<span style="color: #6fb593;">'Oxford'</span>);

<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">select</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">length</span>(city), <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">length</span>(street) <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">from</span> temp;
</code></pre>

<p>
output will be:
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org4399698">
length(City)          Length(street)
10                    6
</pre>
<p>
It&rsquo;s obvious. Very similar to hard disk storage methods.
</p>

<p>
Each type may include a special value called the <code>null</code> value. A <code>null</code> value indicates an
absent value that may exist but be unknown or that may not exist at all. In certain cases,
we may wish to prohibit null values from being entered, as we shall see shortly.

<div id="outline-container-org38d8d70" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org38d8d70">Schema Definition</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org38d8d70">
<p>
We define an SQL elation by using the create table command. The following command creates a
relation <i>department</i> in the database:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">create</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">table</span> <span style="color: #80bcb6;">department</span>
(
    dept_name <span style="color: #cd9575;">varchar</span> (<span style="color: #cd5c60;">20</span>),
    building <span style="color: #cd9575;">varchar</span> (<span style="color: #cd5c60;">15</span>),
    budget <span style="color: #cd9575;">numeric</span> (<span style="color: #cd5c60;">12</span>,<span style="color: #cd5c60;">2</span>),
    <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">primary</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">key</span> (dept_name)
);
</code></pre>

<p>
The relation created above has three attributes, <i>dept_name</i>, which is a character string of
maximum length 20, building, which is a character string of maximum length 15, and budget,
which is a number with 12 digits in total, two of which are after the decimal point. The
<b>create table</b> command also specifies that the dept name attribute is the primary key of the
department relation.
</p>

<p>
The general form of writing this kind of schemas looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgae65bf4">
create table r
    (A1 D1 ,
    A2 D2 ,
    ...,
    An Dn ,
    ⟨integrity-constraint1 ⟩,
    …,
    ⟨integrity-constraintk ⟩);
</pre>

<p>
where \(r\) is the name of the relation, each \(A_{i}\) is the name of an attribute in the schema of
relation \(r\), and \(D_{i}\) is the domain of attribute \(A_{i}\) ; that is, \(D_{i}\) specifies the type of attribute
\(A_{i}\) along with optional constraints that restrict the set of allowed values for \(A_{i}\).
</p>

<p>
The semicolon shown at the end of the create table statements, as well as at the
end of other SQL statements later in this chapter, is optional in many SQL
implementations. In Microsoft&rsquo;s &rsquo;s implementation, it&rsquo;s replaced with <code>GO</code>
command.
</p>

<p>
SQL supports a number of different integrity constraints. In this section, we discuss
only a few of them:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>primary key</b> \((A_{j_1} , A_{j_2} , … , A_{ j_{ m } } )\): The primary-key specification
says that attributes \((A_{j_1} , A_{j_2} , … , A_{ j_{ m } } )\) <i>form</i> the primary key for
the relation. The primary-key attributes. are required to be <i>nonnull</i> and <i>unique</i>; that
is, <b>no tuple can have a null value for a primary-key attribute</b>, and <b>no two tuples in the
relation can be equal on all the primary-key attributes</b>. Although the primary-key
specification is optional, it is generally a good idea to specify a primary key for each
relation.</li>

<li><b>foreign key</b> \((A_{k_1} , A_{k_2} , … , A_{ k_{ m } } )\): references <i>s</i>: The foreign key
specification says that \((A_{k_1} , A_{k_2} , … , A_{ k_{ m } } )\) for any tuple in the
relation must correspond to values of the primary key attributes of some tuple in
relation <i>s</i>.</li>

<li><b>not null</b>: The not null constraint on an attribute specifies that the null value is not
allowed for that attribute; in other words, the constraint excludes the null value from
the domain of that attribute.</li>

<li><b>Check Constraints</b>: A check constraint allows you to define a predicate that a row must
meet to be entered into the table or to be modified. For example, the following check
constraint ensures that the salary column in the Employees table will support only
positive values.</li>

<li><p>
<b>Default Constraints</b>: A default constraint is associated with a particular attribute. It
is an expression that is used as the default value when an explicit value is not specified
for the attribute when you insert a row. For example, the following code defines a default
constraint for the orderts attribute (representing the order’s time stamp):
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">ALTER</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">TABLE</span> <span style="color: #80bcb6;">dbo.Orders</span>
      <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">ADD</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">CONSTRAINT</span> DFT_Orders_orderts
      <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">DEFAULT</span>(SYSDATETIME()) <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">FOR</span> orderts;
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>
SQL prevents any update to the database that violates an integrity constraint. For example,
if a newly inserted or modified tuple in a relation has null values for any primary-key
attribute, or if the tuple has the same value on the primary-key attributes as does another
tuple in the relation, SQL flags an error and prevents the update. Similarly, an insertion
of a course tuple with a dept name value that does not appear in the department relation
would violate the foreign-key constraint on course, and SQL prevents such an insertion from
taking place.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">ALTER</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">TABLE</span> <span style="color: #80bcb6;">dbo.Employees</span>
      <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">ADD</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">CONSTRAINT</span> CHK_Employees_salary
    <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">CHECK</span>(salary &gt; <span style="color: #cd5c60;">0.00</span>);
</code></pre>


<p>
An attempt to insert or update a row with a non-positive salary value will be rejected by the
RDBMS.  Note that a check constraint rejects an attempt to insert or update a row when the
predicate evaluates to FALSE. The modification will be accepted when the predicate evaluates
to either TRUE or UNKNOWN. For example, salary –1000 will be rejected, whereas salaries
50000 and NULL will both be accepted.

<h3 id="orge2c7645">Structure of SQL Queries</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge2c7645">
<p>
The basic structure of an SQL query consists of three clauses: select, from, and where.  A
query takes as its input the relations listed in the from clause, operates on them as
specified in the where and select clauses, and then produces a relation as the result. We
introduce the SQL syntax through examples, and we describe the general structure of SQL
queries later.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org8549a6f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org8549a6f"><i>Select</i></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8549a6f">
<p>
Database tables are objects that store all the data in a database. In a table, data is
logically organized in a row-and-column format which is similar to a spreadsheet.
</p>

<p>
To query data from a table, you use the <code>SELECT</code> statement. The following illustrates the most
basic form of the <code>SELECT</code> statement:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">SELECT</span>
    select_list
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">FROM</span>

<h5 id="org29926bd">Order by</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org29926bd">
<p>
When you use the <code>SELECT</code> statement to query data from a table, the order of rows in the
result set is not guaranteed. It means that SQL can return a result set with an
unspecified order of rows.
</p>

<p>
The only way for you to guarantee that the rows in the result set are sorted is to use the
<code>ORDER BY</code> clause. The following illustrates the ORDER BY clause syntax:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">SELECT</span>
    select_list
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">FROM</span>

<h6 id="org546df6d">Offset Fetch</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org546df6d">
<p>
The <code>OFFSET</code> and <code>FETCH</code> clauses are the options of the ORDER BY clause. They allow you to limit
the number of rows to be returned by a query.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">ORDER</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">BY</span> column_list [<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">ASC</span> |<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">DESC</span>]

</code></pre>

<p>
In this syntax:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The <code>OFFSET</code> clause specifies the number of rows to skip before starting to return rows from
the query. The <code>offset_row_count</code> can be a constant, variable, or parameter that is greater
or equal to zero.</li>

<li>The <code>FETCH</code> clause specifies the number of rows to return after the OFFSET clause has been
processed. The offset_row_count can a constant, variable or scalar that is greater or
equal to one.</li>

<li>The <code>OFFSET</code> clause is mandatory while the <code>FETCH</code> clause is optional. Also, the <code>FIRST</code> and
<code>NEXT</code> are synonyms respectively so you can use them interchangeably. Similarly, you can use
the <code>FIRST</code> and <code>NEXT</code> interchangeably.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Note that you must use the OFFSET and FETCH clauses with the ORDER BY clause. Otherwise, you
will get an error.

The FROM clause of a query is the first clause to be logically processed, and within the
FROM clause, table operators operate on input tables. Microsoft SQL Server supports four
table opera- tors—JOIN, APPLY, PIVOT, and UNPIVOT. The JOIN table operator is standard,
whereas APPLY, PIVOT, and UNPIVOT are T-SQL extensions to the standard. Each table operator
acts on tables provided to it as input, applies a set of logical query processing phases,
and returns a table result.
</p>

<p>
A JOIN table operator operates on two input tables. The three fundamental types of joins are
<i>cross joins, inner joins,</i> and <i>outer joins</i>. These three types of joins differ in how they
apply their logical query processing phases; each type applies a different set of phases. A
cross join applies only one phase—Cartesian Product. An inner join applies two
phases—Cartesian Product and Filter. An outer join applies three phases—Cartesian Product,
Filter, and Add Outer Rows.
</p>

<p>
Logical query processing describes a generic series of logical steps that for any specified
query produces the correct result, whereas physical query processing is the way the query is
processed by the RDBMS engine in practice. Some phases of logical query processing of joins
might sound inefficient, but the inefficient phases will be optimized by the physical
implementation. It’s important to stress the term logical in logical query processing. The
steps in the process apply operations to the input tables based on relational algebra. The
database engine does not have to follow logical query processing phases literally, as long
as it can guarantee that the result that it produces is the same as that dictated by logical
query processing. The SQL Server relational engine often applies many shortcuts for
optimization purposes when it knows that it can still produce the correct result.

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org118d315">
<p>
Logically, a cross join is the simplest type of join. A cross join implements only one
logical query processing phase—a Cartesian Product. This phase operates on the two tables
provided as inputs to the join and produces a Cartesian product of the two. That is, each
row from one input is matched with all rows from the other. So if you have \(m\) rows in one
table and \(n\) rows in the other, you get \(m \cdot n\) rows in the result.

shortly.

<h5 id="org2586960">Inner Joins</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org2586960">
<p>
An inner join applies two logical query processing phases—it applies a Cartesian product
between the two input tables as in a cross join, and then it filters rows based on a
predicate that you specify.
</p>

<p>
Using the ANSI SQL-92 syntax, you specify the INNER JOIN keywords between the table names.
The INNER keyword is optional, because an inner join is the default, so you can specify the
JOIN keyword alone. You specify the predicate that is used to filter rows in a designated
clause called ON. This predicate is also known as the join condition.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">SELECT</span> E.empid, E.firstname, E.lastname, O.orderid

This was the SQL-92 syntax, here is 89&rsquo;s:

</code></pre>

<p>
I strongly recommend that you stick to the ANSI SQL-92 join syntax because it is safer in
several ways.  Suppose you intend to write an inner join query, and by mistake you forget to
specify the join condition. With the ANSI SQL-92 syntax, the query becomes invalid, and the
parser generates an error. For example, try to run the following code.
</p>

A composite join is simply a join based on a predicate that involves more than one attribute
from each side. A composite join is commonly required when you need to join two tables based
on a primary key–foreign key relationship and the relationship is composite; that is, based
on more than one attribute. For example, suppose you have a foreign key defined on
dbo.Table2, columns col1, col2, referencing dbo.Table1, columns col1, col2, and you need to
write a query that joins the two based on a primary key–foreign key relationship. The FROM
clause of the query would look like this.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">FROM</span> dbo.Table1 <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">AS</span> T1

<p>
A join table operator operates only on two tables, but a single query can have multiple
joins. In general, when more than one table operator appears in the FROM clause, the table
operators are logically processed from left to right. That is, the result table of the first
table operator is treated as the left input to the second table operator; the result of the
second table operator is treated as the left input to the third table operator; and so on.
So if there are multiple joins in the FROM clause, the first join operates on two base
tables, but all other joins get the result of the preceding join as their left input.  With
cross joins and inner joins, the database engine can (and often does) internally rearrange
join ordering for optimization purposes because it won’t have an impact on the correctness
of the result of the query.
</p>

<p>
As an example, the following query joins the Customers and Orders tables to match customers
with their orders, and then it joins the result of the first join with the OrderDetails
table to match orders with their order lines.

<h5 id="orgb3bb4eb">Outer Joins</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgb3bb4eb">
<p>
Outer joins were introduced in ANSI SQL-92 and, unlike inner joins and cross joins, have
only one standard syntax—the one in which the JOIN keyword is specified between the table
names, and the join condition is specified in the ON clause. Outer joins apply the two
logical processing phases that inner joins apply (Cartesian product and the ON filter), plus
a third phase called Adding Outer Rows that is unique to this type of join.
</p>

<p>
In an outer join, you mark a table as a “preserved” table by using the keywords LEFT OUTER
JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, or FULL OUTER JOIN between the table names. The OUTER keyword is
optional.  The LEFT keyword means that the rows of the left table are preserved; the RIGHT
keyword means that the rows in the right table are preserved; and the FULL keyword means
that the rows in both the left and right tables are preserved. The third logical query
processing phase of an outer join identifies the rows from the preserved table that did not
find matches in the other table based on the ON predicate. This phase adds those rows to the
result table produced by the first two phases of the join, and uses NULL marks as
placeholders for the attributes from the nonpreserved side of the join in those
outer rows.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">SELECT</span>
    <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">m</span>.<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">name</span> member,
    p.title project
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">FROM</span>
    pm.members <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">m</span>
    <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">RIGHT</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">OUTER</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">JOIN</span> pm.projects p
    <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">ON</span> p.id = <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">m</span>.project_id
</code></pre>

<p>
A common question about outer joins that is the source of a lot of confusion is whether to specify
a predicate in the ON or WHERE clause of a query. You can see that with respect to rows from the
preserved side of an outer join, the filter based on the ON predicate is not final. In other words, the
ON predicate does not determine whether a row will show up in the output, only whether it will be
matched with rows from the other side. So when you need to express a predicate that is not final—
meaning a predicate that determines which rows to match from the nonpreserved side—specify
the predicate in the ON clause. When you need a filter to be applied after outer rows are produced,
and you want the filter to be final, specify the predicate in the WHERE clause. The WHERE clause is
processed after the FROM clause—specifically, after all table operators have been processed and (in
the case of outer joins) after all outer rows have been produced. Also, the WHERE clause is final with
respect to rows that it filters out, unlike the ON clause.

There are circumstances where we would like to apply the aggregate function not only to a

the group by clause. The attribute or attributes given in the group by clause are used to
form groups. Tuples with the same value on all attributes in the group by clause are placed

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7a0de35">
<p>
SQL provides a mechanism for nesting subqueries. A subquery is a select-from-where
expression that is nested within another query. A common use of subqueries is to perform
tests for set membership, make set comparisons, and determine set cardinality by nesting
subqueries in the where clause.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgf890b8d" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="orgf890b8d">Set Membership</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgf890b8d">
<p>
SQL allows testing tuples for membership in a relation. The in connective tests for set
membership, where the set is a collection of values produced by a select clause. The
not in connective tests for the absence of set membership.
</p>

<p>
As an illustration, reconsider the query “Find all the courses taught in the both the
Fall 2017 and Spring 2018 semesters.” Earlier, we wrote such a query by intersecting
two sets: the set of courses taught in Fall 2017 and the set of courses taught in Spring
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>We can take the alternative approach of ﬁnding all courses that were taught in</li>
</ol>
<p>
Fall 2017 and that are also members of the set of courses taught in Spring 2018. This
formulation generates the same results as the previous one did, but it leads us to write
our query using the in connective of SQL. We begin by ﬁnding all courses taught in
Spring 2018, and we write the subquery:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>(<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">select</span> course id
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">from</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">section</span>
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">where</span> semester = <span style="color: #6fb593;">'Spring'</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">and</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">year</span>= <span style="color: #cd5c60;">2018</span>)
</code></pre>

<p>
We then need to find those courses that were taught in the Fall 2017 and that appear
in the set of courses obtained in the subquery. We do so by nesting the subquery in the
where clause of an outer query. The resulting query is:
</p>


<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">select</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">distinct</span> course id

SQL includes a feature for testing whether a subquery has any tuples in its result. The
exists construct returns the value true if the argument subquery is nonempty. Using the
exists construct, we can write the query “Find all courses taught in both the Fall 2017
semester and in the Spring 2018 semester” in still another way:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">select</span> course id
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">from</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">section</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">as</span> S
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">where</span> semester = <span style="color: #6fb593;">'Fall'</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">and</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">year</span>= <span style="color: #cd5c60;">2017</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">and</span>
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">exists</span> (<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">select</span> *
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">from</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">section</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">as</span> T
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">where</span> semester = <span style="color: #6fb593;">'Spring'</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">and</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">year</span>= <span style="color: #cd5c60;">2018</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">and</span>
S.course id= T .course id);
</code></pre>


<p>
SQL includes a Boolean function for testing whether a subquery has duplicate tuples
in its result. The unique construct11 returns the value true if the argument subquery
contains no duplicate tuples. Using the unique construct, we can write the query “Find
all courses that were offered at most once in 2017” as follows:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">select</span> T .course id
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">from</span> course <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">as</span> T
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">where</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">unique</span> (<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">select</span> R.course id
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">from</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">section</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">as</span> R
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">where</span> T .course id= R.course id <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">and</span>
R.<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">year</span> = <span style="color: #cd5c60;">2017</span>);
</code></pre>

<p>
Note that if a course were not oﬀered in 2017, the subquery would return an empty
result, and the unique predicate would evaluate to true on the empty set.
An equivalent version of this query not using the unique construct is:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">select</span> T .course id
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">from</span> course <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">as</span> T

SQL allows a subquery expression to be used in the from clause. The key concept ap- plied
here is that any select-from-where expression returns a relation as a result and, therefore,
can be inserted into another select-from-where anywhere that a relation can appear.

Producing multiple copies of rows can be achieved with a fundamental technique that utilizes
a cross  join. If you need to produce five copies of each employee row, you need to perform
a cross join be- tween the Employees table and a table that has five rows; alternatively,
you can perform a cross join  between Employees and a table that has more than five rows,
but filter only five from that table in the  WHERE clause. The Nums table is very convenient
for this purpose. Simply cross Employees and Nums,  and filter from Nums as many rows as the
number of requested copies (five, in this case).

Suppose that you need to query the Orders table in the TSQL2012 database and return
information about the order that has the maximum order ID in the table. You could
accomplish the task by using a variable. The code could retrieve the maximum order ID from
the Orders table and store the result in a variable. Then the code could query the Orders
table and filter the order where the order ID is equal to the value stored in the
variable. The following code demonstrates this technique.
</p>

Suppose that you need to query the Orders table in the TSQL2012 database and return, for
each order, information about the current order and also the previous order ID. The
concept of “previous” implies logical ordering, but because you know that the rows in a
table have no order, you need to come up with a logical equivalent to the concept of
“previous” that can be phrased with a T-SQL expression. One example of such a logical
equivalent is “the maximum value that is smaller than the current value.” This phrase can
be expressed in T-SQL with a correlated subquery like this.

<p>
A table expression is a named query expression that represents a valid relational table. You
can use table expressions in data manipulation statements much like you use other tables.
</p>

<p>
Table expressions are not physically materialized anywhere—they are virtual. When you query
a table expression, the inner query gets un-nested. In other words, the outer query and the
inner query are merged into one query directly against the underlying objects. <span class="underline">The benefits
of using table expressions are typically related to logical aspects of your code and not to
performance</span>. For example, table expressions help you simplify your solutions by using a
modular approach. Table expressions also help you circumvent certain restrictions in the
language, such as the inability to refer to column aliases assigned in the SELECT clause in
query clauses that are logically processed before the <code>SELECT</code> clause.

<h4 id="org6527f3f">Derived Tables</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6527f3f">
<p>
Derived tables (also known as table subqueries) are defined in the FROM clause of an outer
query. Their scope of existence is the outer query. As soon as the outer query is finished,
the derived table is gone.
</p>

<p>
You specify the query that defines the derived table within parentheses, followed by the AS
clause and the derived table name. For example, the following code defines a derived table
called <code>USACusts</code> based on a query that returns all customers from the United States, and the
outer query selects all rows from the derived table.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>USE TSQL2012;
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">SELECT</span> *
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">FROM</span> (<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">SELECT</span> custid, companyname

</code></pre>

<p>
A query must meet 2 requirements to be valid to define a table expression of any kind:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><b>Order is not guaranteed</b>. A table expression is supposed to represent a relational
table, and the rows in a relational table have no guaranteed order. Recall that this
aspect of a relation stems from set theory. For this reason, standard SQL <b>disallows an
ORDER BY clause in queries</b> that are used to define table expressions, unless the <b>ORDER
BY</b> serves another purpose besides presentation. An example for such an exception is when
the query uses the <b>OFFSET-FETCH filter</b>. T-SQL enforces similar restrictions, with
similar exceptions—when TOP or OFFSET-FETCH is also specified. In the context of a query
with the TOP or OFFSET-FETCH filter, the ORDER BY clause serves as part of the
specification of the filter. If you use a query with TOP or OFFSET-FETCH and ORDER BY to
define a table expression, ORDER BY is only guaranteed to serve the filtering-related
purpose and not the usual presentation purpose. If the outer query against the table
expression does not have a presentation ORDER BY, the output is not guaranteed to be
returned in any particular order. See the “Views and the ORDER BY Clause” section later
in this chapter for more detail on this item.</li>

<li><b>All columns must have names</b>. All columns in a table must have names; therefore, you</li>
</ol>
<p>
must assign column aliases to all expressions in the SELECT list of the query that is used
to define a table expression.

<h4 id="org3d66ef5">Common Table Expressions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3d66ef5">
<p>
Common table expressions (CTEs) are another standard form of table expression very similar to derived tables, yet with a couple of important advantages.
CTEs are defined by using a WITH statement and have the following general form.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">WITH</span> &lt;CTE_Name&gt;[(&lt;target_column_list&gt;)]
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">AS</span>
(
&lt;inner_query_defining_CTE&gt;
)
&lt;outer_query_against_CTE&gt;;
</code></pre>

<p>
The inner query defining the CTE must follow all requirements mentioned earlier to be valid
to define a table expression. As a simple example, the following code defines a CTE called
USACusts based on a query that returns all customers from the United States, and the outer
query selects all rows from the CTE.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">WITH</span> USACusts <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">AS</span>

<h4 id="orga40948e">Recursive Common Table Expressions</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga40948e">
<p>
CTEs are unique among table expressions because they have recursive capabilities. A recursive
CTE is defined by at least two queries (more are possible)—at least one query known as the anchor
member and at least one query known as the recursive member. The general form of a basic recursive
CTE looks like the following.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">WITH</span> &lt;CTE_Name&gt;[(&lt;target_column_list&gt;)]
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">AS</span>
(
&lt;anchor_member&gt;
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">UNION</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">ALL</span>
&lt;recursive_member&gt;
)
&lt;outer_query_against_CTE&gt;;
</code></pre>

<p>
The anchor member is a query that returns a valid relational result table—like a query that is used
to define a nonrecursive table expression. The anchor member query is invoked only once.
</p>


<p>
The recursive member is a query that has a reference to the CTE name. The reference to the
CTE name represents what is logically the previous result set in a sequence of executions.
The first time that the recursive member is invoked, the previous result set represents
whatever the anchor member returned. In each subsequent invocation of the recursive member,
the reference to the CTE name represents the result set returned by the previous invocation
of the recursive member. The recursive member has no explicit recursion termination
check—the termination check is implicit. The recursive member is invoked repeatedly until it
returns an empty set or exceeds some limit.
</p>

<p>
Both queries must be compatible in terms of the number of columns they return and the data
types of the corresponding columns.
</p>

<p>
The reference to the CTE name in the outer query represents the unified result sets of the
invocation of the anchor member and all invocations of the recursive member.
</p>

<p>
The following code demonstrates how to use a recursive CTE to return information about an
employee (Don Funk, employee ID 2) and all of the employee’s subordinates in all levels
(direct or indirect).
</p>


<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">WITH</span> EmpsCTE <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">AS</span>

The two types of table expressions discussed so far—derived tables and CTEs—have a very
limited scope, which is the single-statement scope. As soon as the outer query against those
table expressions is finished, they are gone. This means that derived tables and CTEs <b>are
not reusable.</b>
</p>


<p>
Views and inline table-valued functions (inline TVFs) are two reusable types of table
expressions; their definitions are stored as database objects. After they have been created,
those objects are permanent parts of the database and are only removed from the database if
they are explicitly dropped.

</code></pre>

<p>
Note that the general recommendation to avoid using <code>SELECT *</code> has specific relevance in the
context of views. The columns are enumerated in the compiled form of the view, and <b>new table
columns will not be automatically added to the view</b>. For example, suppose you define a view
based on the query <code>SELECT * FROM dbo.T1</code>, and at the view creation time the table T1 has the
columns col1 and col2. SQL Server stores information only on those two columns in the view’s
metadata. If you alter the definition of the table to add new columns, those new columns
will not be added to the view. You can refresh the view’s metadata by using the stored
procedure <code>sp_refreshview</code> or <code>sp_refreshsqlmodule</code>, but to avoid confusion, the best practice
is to explicitly list the column names that you need in the definition of the view. If
columns are added to the underlying tables and you need them in the view, use the ALTER VIEW
statement to revise the view definition accordingly.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org047101a" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org047101a">Order</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org047101a">
<p>
The query that you use to define a view must meet all requirements mentioned earlier with
respect to table expressions in the context of derived tables. The view should not guarantee
any order to the rows, all view columns must have names, and all column names must be
unique. In this section, I elaborate a bit about the ordering issue, which is a fundamental
point that is crucial to understand.
</p>

<p>
Remember that a presentation ORDER BY clause is not allowed in the query defining a table
expression because there’s no order among the rows of a relational table. An attempt to
create an ordered view is absurd because it violates fundamental properties of a relation as
defined by the relational model. If you need to return rows from a view sorted for
presentation purposes, you shouldn’t try to make the view something it shouldn’t be.
Instead, you should specify a presentation <code>ORDER BY</code> clause in the outer query against the
view.
</p>


<p>
Because T-SQL allows an ORDER BY clause in a view when TOP or OFFSET-FETCH is also specified,
some people think that they can create “ordered views.” One of the ways to try to achieve this is by
using <code>TOP (100) PERCENT</code>, like the following.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">ALTER</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">VIEW</span> <span style="color: #80bcb6;">Sales.USACusts</span>
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">AS</span>
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">SELECT</span> TOP (<span style="color: #cd5c60;">100</span>) PERCENT
custid, companyname, contactname, contacttitle, address,
city, region, postalcode, country, phone, fax
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">FROM</span> Sales.Customers
<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">WHERE</span> country = N<span style="color: #6fb593;">'USA'</span>

<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">GO</span>
</code></pre>

<p>
Even though the code is technically valid and the view is created, you should be aware that
because the query is used to define a table expression, the ORDER BY clause here is only
guaranteed to serve the logical filtering purpose for the TOP option. If you query the view
and don’t specify an ORDER BY clause in the outer query, presentation order is not
guaranteed.

When you create or alter a view, you can specify view attributes and options as part of the view
definition. In the header of the view, under the <code>WITH</code> clause, you can specify attributes such as
<code>ENCRYPTION</code> and <code>SCHEMABINDING</code>, and at the end of the query you can specify <code>WITH CHECK
OPTION</code>.

<h6 id="org589f266">Encryption</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org589f266">
<p>
The ENCRYPTION option is available when you create or alter views, stored procedures, triggers, and
user-defined functions (UDFs). The ENCRYPTION option indicates that SQL Server will internally store
the text with the definition of the object in an obfuscated format. The obfuscated text is not directly
visible to users through any of the catalog objects—only to privileged users through special means.
</p>

<p>
Consider the following definition:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">ALTER</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">VIEW</span> <span style="color: #80bcb6;">Sales.USACusts</span>

    <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">FROM</span> Sales.Customers
    <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">WHERE</span>
  country = N<span style="color: #6fb593;">'USA'</span>;

<span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">GO</span>
</code></pre>

<p>
To get the definition of the view, invoke the <code>OBJECT_DEFINITION</code> function like this.
</p>
<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">SELECT</span> OBJECT_DEFINITION(OBJECT_ID(<span style="color: #6fb593;">'Sales.USACusts'</span>));
</code></pre>

<pre class="example" id="orgbb274c0">

    WHERE
  country = N'USA';
</pre>

<p>
The text with the definition of the view is available because the view was created without the
<code>ENCRYPTION</code> option.

The purpose of CHECK OPTION is to prevent modifications through the view that conflict with
the view’s filter—assuming that one exists in the query defining the view.
</p>

<p>
The view is currently defined without CHECK OPTION. This means that you can currently insert
rows through the view with customers from countries other than the United States, and you
can update existing customers through the view, changing their country to one other than the
United States. For example, the following code successfully inserts a customer with company
name Customer ABCDE from the United Kingdom through the view.
</p>


<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">INSERT</span> <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">INTO</span> Sales.USACusts(

</code></pre>



<p>
Similarly, if you update a customer row through the view, changing the country attribute to a
country other than the United States, the update makes it to the table. But that customer information
doesn’t show up anymore in the view because it doesn’t satisfy the view’s query filter.
</p>

<p>
If you want to prevent modifications that conflict with the view’s filter, add WITH CHECK OPTION
at the end of the query defining the view.

Set operators are operators that are applied between two input sets—or, to use the more
accurate SQL term, multisets—that result from two input queries. Remember, <b>a multiset is not
a true set</b>, because it can contain duplicates. When I use the term multiset
I’m referring to the intermediate results from two input queries that might contain
duplicates. Although there are two multisets as inputs to an operator, depending on the
flavor of the operator, the result is either a set or a multiset. If the operator is a true
set operator (a DISTINCT flavor), the result is a set with no duplicates. If the operator is
a multiset operator (an ALL flavor), the result is a multiset with possible duplicates.

SQL defines precedence among set operators. The INTERSECT operator precedes UNION and EXCEPT,
and UNION and EXCEPT are considered equal. In a query that contains multiple set operators, first
INTERSECT operators are evaluated, and then operators with the same precedence are evaluated
based on order of appearance.
</p>

<p>
Consider the following query, which shows how INTERSECT precedes EXCEPT.
</p>
<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">SELECT</span> country, region, city <span style="color: #4d9391; font-weight: bold;">FROM</span> Production.Suppliers

</code></pre>
<p>
Because INTERSECT precedes EXCEPT, the INTERSECT operator is evaluated first, even though it
appears second. Therefore, the meaning of this query is, “locations that are supplier
locations but not (locations that are both employee and customer locations).”

Write a query that returns customer and employee pairs that had order activity in January

Subqueries terminology might sound a little bit confusing, this section provides some basic
glossary that might help you.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Self-contained subqueries</b>.
Every subquery has an outer query that it belongs to. Self-contained subqueries are
subqueries that are independent of the outer query that they belong to. Self-contained
subqueries are very convenient to debug, because you can always highlight the subquery
code, run it, and ensure that it does what it’s supposed to do. Logically, it’s as if the
subquery code is evaluated only once before the outer query is evaluated, and then the
outer query uses the result of the subquery. The following sections take a look at some
concrete examples of self-contained subqueries.

<li><b>Self-Contained Multivalued Subquery</b>.
A multivalued subquery is a subquery that returns multiple values as a single column,
regardless of whether the subquery is self-contained. Some predicates, such as the IN
predicate, operate on a multivalued subquery.</li>
<li><b>Correlated Subqueries</b>.
Correlated subqueries are subqueries that refer to attributes from the table that appears
in the outer query. This means that the subquery is dependent on the outer query and
cannot be invoked independently. Logically, it’s as if the subquery is evaluated
separately for each outer row.</li>
