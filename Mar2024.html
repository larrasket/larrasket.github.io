I find the 'books community' (wherever it is, goodreads or some social network
groups) to be one of the most asinine and silly ideas I have ever seen.  Books
are about ideas, not about books themselves. Who, pray tell, was responsible for
reducing books to mere objects fixated upon themselves rather than their
profound ideas? It was those who were too indolent and unenlightened to
comprehend the rudimentary fundamentals of the world. "Oh yeah, books did not
work for me," says some dropout from a US preparatory school, for they saw books
merely as inanimate objects that contained some inconsequential material which
failed to 'work' for them. This is the essence of the term 'bookworm,' a decent
description by an individual who was unable to grasp someone else's discipline
(some philosophical idea, mathematical branch, physic, or anything) and,
therefore, reduced it to a level they could comprehend - that being books.  The
reasons underlying the formation of these communities are purely
pseudointellectuality. For a society to simultaneously read and discuss the
works of Chomsky and Netanyahu is an impossibility (which I see a lot in places
like goodreads), for it lacks the harmonious congruity necessary for such a
feat. I again: books are not about books. It is the ideas contained therein that
possess significance, not the books themselves.

Days and events hold no inherent specialty, for they are but mere markers of
time. Their occurrence brings no inherent alteration, nor do they impact any
change. On the morrow, Ramadan shall commence and, as is the custom, many shall
choose to amend their ways. Some will stop listening to music, others shall stop
mistreating themselves, and the like. Though I find the overall notion
commendable, the idea of it being a limited-time resolution does not sit well
with me. I have encountered those who abstain from music only during Ramadan,
and this perplexes me. They either normalize their misdeeds in their
subconscious or are foolish enough to believe that their actions during Ramadan
are different from the rest of the year. I suspect it to be the former, for it
is a curious thought that they accept their wrongdoing as acceptable for most of
the year but not during Ramadan. Do they desist from theft and other unethical
behavior solely during Ramadan? This is questionable. If you believe that
certain things are bad, why you are not trying to apply yourself to them?
Especially that it's pretty possible through 30 days, or you are not looking for
virtues out of resolutions?
