I&rsquo;ve been reading recently Distributed Systems by Steen, M. v., &amp;
Tanenbaum, A. S..<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Maarten van Steen and Andrew S.

introduction into the topic. Something I liked really from the book, how it
starts with distinguishing between convoluted terms like distributed systems and
decentralized systems. I experience this issue a lot while talking in an
engineering context and I find someone suggesting a distributed approach,
however, many of the listeners confuse it with other definitions like
service-based architecture and the like.

<p>
In this article I will go quickly over that distinction.
</p>

<p>
To understand the difference between distributed and decentralized
systems, we must first consider how networked systems emerge. There are
typically two distinct evolutionary paths that lead to computers being
connected together.
</p>

<p>
The first path, which we might call the integrative approach, starts
with independent, often heterogeneous systems that need to be connected
to enable new functionalities or services. These systems typically exist
within different administrative domains, were created separately, and
are brought together because of emerging needs to share data or
functionality. The European air traffic control system exemplifies this
approach - numerous national systems, each independently developed and
operated, must interconnect to enable coordinated management of
continental airspace.
</p>

<p>
The second path, which we call the expansive approach, begins with a
single system that grows beyond the capabilities of a single computer,
requiring additional machines to meet operational demands. This
expansion is typically driven by performance needs, reliability
requirements, or geographic distribution of users. Amazon&rsquo;s retail
platform followed this trajectory - what began as a simple online
bookstore running on a few servers has expanded to a massive
infrastructure of hundreds of thousands of computers spread across the
globe.
</p>

<p>
These different origins lead to fundamentally different system
characteristics, which we can distinguish as follows:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>A decentralized system</b> is a networked computer system in which
processes and resources are <i>necessarily</i> spread across multiple
computers.</li>
<li><b>A distributed system</b> is a networked computer system in which
processes and resources are <i>sufficiently</i> spread across multiple
computers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The key distinction here lies in the words &ldquo;necessarily&rdquo; versus
&ldquo;sufficiently.&rdquo; In decentralized systems, distribution is a fundamental
requirement dictated by constraints that make centralization impossible.
In distributed systems, distribution is a design choice implemented to
achieve specific quality attributes.
</p>
<div id="outline-container-org025e83c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org025e83c">When Distribution Cannot Be Avoided</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org025e83c">
<p>
Decentralized systems emerge when resources and processes must be
distributed across multiple computers due to constraints that make
centralization impossible or infeasible. These constraints typically
fall into several categories:
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgeb8f96a" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgeb8f96a">Administrative and Organizational Boundaries</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgeb8f96a">
<p>
Many systems must operate across organizational boundaries where each
participant maintains independent control over their resources. Medical
research provides a clear example of this constraint. Patient data is
typically stored within individual hospital systems due to privacy
regulations, institutional policies, and legal requirements. When
researchers want to develop machine learning models that leverage data
from multiple hospitals, they cannot simply aggregate all data in one
location.
</p>

<p>
This necessity drives the development of federated learning systems,
where the model training algorithm travels to each hospital&rsquo;s local data
center, performs computations on the local data, and then shares only
the model updates (not the raw data) with a central coordinating
service. Stanford University&rsquo;s DAWN project has implemented such a
system for medical image analysis, allowing multiple medical centers to
collectively train diagnostic algorithms without sharing protected
patient data.
</p>

<p>
The constraint here is not technical but organizational and regulatory -
the data must remain under the control of the original institution. The
decentralization is necessary, not optional.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org0eedc1f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0eedc1f">Trust Limitations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0eedc1f">
<p>
Some systems operate in environments where no single entity can or
should be trusted with complete control. Financial systems often
encounter this constraint, particularly when facilitating transactions
between parties with limited trust relationships.
</p>

<p>
Bitcoin and other blockchain-based systems represent quintessential
examples of trust-driven decentralization. Participants in these
networks do not trust any single authority to maintain a ledger of
transactions. Instead, the ledger is fully replicated across thousands
of nodes, with a consensus protocol ensuring agreement on the
transaction history despite potentially malicious actors.
</p>

<p>
The Bitcoin network processes hundreds of millions of dollars in
transactions daily without requiring users to trust any central
authority. This approach fundamentally differs from traditional banking
systems where a central authority (the bank) maintains transaction
records. The decentralization isn&rsquo;t merely a design preference—it&rsquo;s
the core innovation that enables the system&rsquo;s trustless operation.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org91d4454" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org91d4454">Geographic and Physical Constraints</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org91d4454">
<p>
Some systems are decentralized because their physical components must
exist in specific geographic locations. Weather monitoring networks
illustrate this constraint clearly. Weather sensors must be physically
distributed across the geography they monitor—sensors in New York tell
us nothing about the weather in Los Angeles.
</p>

<p>
The National Weather Service operates thousands of monitoring stations
across the United States, each collecting local atmospheric data. This
data feeds into predictive models that forecast weather patterns. The
decentralization of data collection is an inherent requirement of the
system&rsquo;s purpose, not a design choice.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, the control systems for power grids must be partially
decentralized because of the physical distribution of generation and
transmission infrastructure. While centralized oversight exists, local
control systems must make real-time decisions based on local conditions,
as the time required to communicate with a central authority would make
the system too slow to respond to rapidly changing conditions.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org3196137" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3196137">Regulatory Requirements</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3196137">
<p>
Increasingly, regulatory frameworks require certain types of data to
remain within specific geographic or jurisdictional boundaries. The
European Union&rsquo;s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and similar
regulations worldwide have forced many global companies to decentralize
their data storage and processing.
</p>

<p>
Microsoft, for example, operates distinct Azure cloud regions throughout
the world, with data centers that keep European customer data within EU
borders. This decentralization isn&rsquo;t driven by technical considerations
but by regulatory requirements that make centralization legally
impossible.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org932568c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org932568c">When Distribution Is a Choice</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org932568c">
<p>
Distributed systems, by contrast, involve spreading processes and
resources across multiple computers to achieve goals like scalability,
fault tolerance, or performance optimization—not because such
distribution is fundamentally necessary. In these systems,
centralization would be theoretically possible, if not always practical.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org3149a91" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3149a91">Web Search Engines</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3149a91">
<p>
Google&rsquo;s search engine handles billions of queries daily across a
massive distributed infrastructure. When users enter a search query,
their request is processed by multiple systems: one to parse the query,
others to search different portions of the index, and still others to
rank and assemble the results.
</p>

<p>
This distribution isn&rsquo;t necessary in the sense that a single
(theoretical) supercomputer could perform all these functions. Rather,
Google distributes its system to achieve specific quality attributes:
scalability to handle the query volume, fault tolerance to maintain
service despite hardware failures, and performance to deliver results
within milliseconds.
</p>

<p>
The company famously built its infrastructure using thousands of
commodity servers rather than a few high-end machines, making an
explicit design choice to distribute processing horizontally. This
approach provided cost advantages and simplified scaling as demand grew.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgcaa97ba" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgcaa97ba">Content Delivery Networks</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcaa97ba">
<p>
Akamai operates over 340,000 servers in more than 135 countries. When
users visit websites served through Akamai&rsquo;s CDN, they&rsquo;re transparently
redirected to nearby servers that host copies of the requested content.
</p>

<p>
This distribution isn&rsquo;t necessary for the content to be accessible—a
single central server could theoretically serve all users. However, by
distributing content based on geographic proximity to users, CDNs reduce
latency, improve bandwidth utilization, and enhance the user experience.
The system makes sophisticated decisions about which content to
replicate where, based on usage patterns and performance metrics.
</p>

<p>
Netflix employs a similar strategy, placing content caching servers
within internet service providers&rsquo; networks. This distributed approach
allows them to deliver high-definition video streams to millions of
concurrent users without overwhelming internet backbones—a sufficient
distribution to achieve their performance requirements.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org90104c4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org90104c4">Centralized Solutions Work</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org90104c4">
<p>
A persistent misconception in system design holds that centralized
solutions are inherently flawed—unable to scale, vulnerable to
failures, and limited in performance. This view often leads to
unnecessary distribution, introducing complexity without corresponding
benefits.
</p>

<p>
In reality, logically centralized systems can be implemented in
physically distributed ways that provide excellent scalability and
reliability. The Domain Name System (DNS) exemplifies this approach.
Logically, DNS is organized as a global hierarchical tree, with the root
of the tree appearing to be a centralization point and potential single
point of failure. However, the root is physically implemented as 13 sets
of servers, each set itself implemented as a distributed system using
anycast routing to direct queries to the nearest instance.
</p>

<p>
This design delivers the simplicity and consistency of a centralized
approach with the resilience and scalability of distribution. Despite
numerous distributed denial-of-service attacks targeting the DNS root
servers over the years, the system has maintained remarkable stability.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, many modern cloud services present centralized interfaces to
users while implementing distributed architectures behind the scenes.
Amazon&rsquo;s S3 storage service appears to users as a single, infinitely
scalable storage system, hiding the complex distribution mechanisms that
enable this illusion.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgd76cb20" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd76cb20">Necessity versus Sufficiency</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd76cb20">
<p>
The key distinction between decentralized and distributed systems stems
from whether the distribution is necessary or merely sufficient:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>In decentralized systems, distribution is a fundamental requirement
imposed by external constraints. The system cannot function without
distribution because administrative boundaries, trust limitations,
geographic constraints, or regulatory requirements make
centralization impossible.</li>

<li>In distributed systems, distribution is a design choice made to
achieve specific quality attributes like scalability, fault
tolerance, or performance. Centralization would be theoretically
possible, though perhaps impractical for various reasons.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This distinction has profound implications for system design,
implementation, and operation:
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org3bc87ac" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3bc87ac">Complexity Management</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3bc87ac">
<p>
Decentralized systems must manage the inherent complexity of
distribution without the option of simplifying through centralization.
This often requires sophisticated consensus mechanisms, complex security
models, and careful handling of partial failures.
</p>

<p>
The Google Spanner database illustrates how challenging this can be. To
maintain consistent data across globally distributed data centers,
Spanner relies on GPS receivers and atomic clocks to provide precise
time synchronization. This extraordinary complexity is necessary because
the system must maintain consistency across administrative domains while
supporting global distribution.
</p>

<p>
Distributed systems can often leverage centralized control planes even
while distributing data and processing. Kubernetes, the container
orchestration system, uses a centralized control plane to manage
distributed container workloads, simplifying many aspects of system
management.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org1532103" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1532103">Performance Expectations and Tradeoffs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1532103">
<p>
Decentralized systems typically incur performance penalties for their
necessary distribution. Bitcoin processes only a few transactions per
second compared to Visa&rsquo;s tens of thousands, because its decentralized
consensus mechanism prioritizes trustlessness over throughput.
</p>

<p>
Distributed systems can often achieve performance improvements through
their distribution. Hadoop distributes data processing across computer
clusters to enable analysis of datasets too large for single machines,
turning distribution into a performance advantage rather than a
liability.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org604eb8c" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org604eb8c">Evolution and Governance</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org604eb8c">
<p>
Decentralized systems face unique challenges in evolution. Changes to
the Bitcoin protocol, for example, require broad consensus among a
diverse community of miners, developers, and users. This governance by
consensus makes rapid evolution difficult but protects the system&rsquo;s
decentralized nature.
</p>

<p>
Distributed systems that remain under unified administrative control can
evolve more rapidly. Amazon can update its distributed retail platform
without seeking consensus beyond its own engineering teams, allowing for
more agile responses to changing requirements.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgbc47eda" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgbc47eda">Minimal Distribution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbc47eda">
<p>
The distinction between distributed and decentralized systems—based on whether
distribution is sufficient or necessary—provides a powerful framework for
understanding networked computer systems. Decentralized systems distribute
because they must, accepting the inherent complexity as the cost of addressing
administrative, trust, geographic, or regulatory constraints. Distributed
systems distribute because doing so provides benefits that outweigh the added
complexity.
</p>

<p>
This distinction isn&rsquo;t merely academic. It guides fundamental architectural
decisions, influences technology selection, shapes operational practices, and
determines how systems evolve over time. By understanding whether your system
needs to be decentralized or merely distributed, you can make more informed
tradeoffs between simplicity and distribution.
</p>

<p>
As computing continues to expand across organizational and geographic
boundaries, more systems will incorporate both necessary decentralization and
sufficient distribution. The most successful architectures will be those that
apply each approach judiciously—decentralizing what must be decentralized,
distributing what benefits from distribution, and centralizing everything else.
</p>

<p>
The principle of minimal distribution—distribute only what is necessary or
sufficiently beneficial—serves as a valuable guide for navigating the
complexity of modern networked systems. By embracing this principle, architects
can build systems that balance the benefits of distribution against its
significant costs, delivering solutions that are as simple as possible but as
distributed as necessary.
