I remember years ago when I was watching Black Mirror, an interesting show about
dystopian dark future of technology, I recommended it to some people I knew, I
thought it might help me to consolidate my arguments against the influence that
modernism technology (like social media sites) has against them, how they can
be tracked and controlled; however all of them couldn&rsquo;t complete the show not
even a \(>1\) number of episodes. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable watching this&rdquo;, they
said.
</p>

<p>
At this point I felt they would think it would be discourteous of me to ask
about &ldquo;why?&rdquo; or even to refer to them that this means that there is something
wrong: having a TV show or an idea to make you feel &rsquo;uncomfortable&rsquo; means nothing
but having a great fragility in your mind, and it is in a very weak state.
</p>

<p>
This actually made me to think more about how most of new generations treat
comfort, they sanctify it. Which is a big issue in my opinion, simply comfort
does not lead to anything but a stable (in the sense of a bad incessantness)
state of existence. I personally consider the absolute seeking of comfort to be
one of the fetid thoughts a man could have, for thee supposed to make a change,
and a change is never led by comfort. &ldquo;For believe me,  the secret for
harvesting from existence the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment
is: <i>to live dangerously</i>! Build your cities on the slopes of Vesuvius! Send your
ships into uncharted seas! Live at war with your peers and yourselves! Be
robbers and conquerors as long as you cannot be rulers and possessors, you
seekers of knowledge! Soon the age will be past when you could be content to
live hidden in forests like shy deer! At long last the search for knowledge will
reach out for its due: — it will want to rule and possess, and you with it!&rdquo;<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

<p>
Comfort is a key of ignoring all self-vulnerabilities; you don&rsquo;t feel
comfortable to go on a fight with someone (if you had to for any reason), which
might be a wise idea (refer to <a href="anthology_of_les_passions_de_l_ame.html#3wacz0q02wj0">Les Passions de l&rsquo;âme</a> which is a great book by
Descartes that explain why all passions and feelings are useful, including fear)
if they are much stronger than you; however this clearly highlight an obvious
vulnerability in your body power, working on it will definitely change the fight
to be a great idea, but accepting the &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable&rdquo; to do so will
only keep you in your low levels.

“Where you stumble, there lies your treasure. The very cave you are afraid to
enter turns out to be the source of what you are looking for. The damned thing
in the cave, that was so dreaded, has become the center.” ― Joseph Campbell, The
Power of Myth.
