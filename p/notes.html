I&rsquo;ve been recently reading a paper on mate rejection, a stringent one<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Kelly, A. J., Dubbs, S. L., &amp; Barlow, F. K. (2016). An Evolutionary Perspective on

</span>. <i>Rejection</i>
hurts much. Two primitive reasons for feeling bad about being rejects are both
correlated to a tribal human nature of being an anomaly, useless overload inside
a community (which is relatively applicable to position-related rejections). In a
more tribal context this should give us a sense of danger that we are in a
precarious situation and we have to resolve it immediately (that is probably our
&rsquo;feeling bad&rsquo; of rejection). An ubiquitous example (an examined one) is the
famous cyberball study by K. D. Williams<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

</span> . Understanding this shall help you
to understand that it is a little bit passable pain; it&rsquo;s a reflex action of our
human nature.
</p>

<p>
However, and I wish I&rsquo;ve learned this earlier, getting rejected in many cases
implies an inconsistent self-estimation status if, and only if, it was a
non-stroke-of-luck proposal. What I mean by that is proposals should lay as
win-win situations for both sides which is a very basic concept of bartering
(this is not always very applicable in some other types of proposals, as of
relationships).  Getting rejected in a dumb trail proposal (or as people
stupidly promoting it: &ldquo;just give it a try you won&rsquo;t lose anything&rdquo;) doesn&rsquo;t
mean much, it might be a passable hurt for any sides because it&rsquo;s just a wasted
time (the rejected party shall feel more hurt, due its fragile nature) on the
other hand, non-dumb proposals I believe are much malicious because—as
prementioned-it probably reveals invalid self-perception which is very
dangerous, in my opinion.

<h2 id="iuybdvb0fzj0">On Stupid Individuals</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org571abe9">
<p>
Unlike the majority of (pseudo)intellectuals, I acknowledge the existence of
by-nature-stupid, low-IQ, individuals. they are out there, they live with us, in
some places they present the preponderance of the average IQ.
</p>

<p>
Here is my successful contrivance that worked successfully with many stupid
people (note that it&rsquo;s necessary to have such a skill to handle those creatures,
you will have to deal with them in your life after all) I think that the most
effective way to teach them how to think, is by teaching them thinking before
they actually try to think. And this worked very fine with me, I&rsquo;m not referring
only to the mental effect that I noticed but the way I tried to approach it was
much more appropriate to them than trying to teach them real knowledge or
thinking methodologies which always implied to them how stupid I think they are,
instead I just ask them (in spiel of course) to think before they think about
something: shall I think about this? Am I really qualified to trust my thoughts&rsquo;
conclusion of this very topic? It&rsquo;s a very basic method and I can confirm it
yields very fine even in smarter people.

I&rsquo;m currently interesting in doing some personal work in chess programming. I
noticed a common pattern, that is after passing 1800~2300 in a chess rating
system (like Glicko), chess basically transforms into a job related to
memorization and psychological gaming instead of abstraction and observation,
and that&rsquo;s what basically high-rated players depend on, the game is no longer a
game. Take the last Tata Steel Masters tournament as an example, in Parham
Maghsoodloo vs. Magnus Carlsen game<label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
<a href="https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=2457693">https://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=2457693</a>
</span>, people has noticed an inaccuracy in
Magnus&rsquo; playing that is 7. 🨃h4 🨃g4 which doesn&rsquo;t make sense to many players,
Magnus won the game and he was asked about this move, he said that he wanted to
&rsquo;surprise&rsquo; Maghsoodloo, so Maghsoodloo probably played that King&rsquo;s Indian
Defense thousands of times and he memorizes the position very well, breaking
this glibness in his playing would gave Magnus more advantage, not because he
played a better move but he tried to break the opponent&rsquo;s memorization. Another
player John Bartholomew has a strategy in playing blitz games that is to make
the opponent think so they lose time and you win by time, even if this mean
doing a stupid move like losing the queen, the opponent shall think &ldquo;is there a
checkmate that is hiding?&rdquo;, so basically <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKuIHy0260M">using the clock as a Weapon</a>.
