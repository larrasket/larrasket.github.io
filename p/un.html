How does the US manipulate global policy using sanctions and political aids as a
carrot and stick strategy.
</p>

</div>

<p>
For anyone who understands the basics of the policies of interests, any kind of
political aid is always interpreted as matter of interest or to be used as a
pressure method in the future, U.S. foreign assistance to Egypt is a great
example for that, not only it makes Egypt more dependent on US-Arms systems
which implies more surveillance (only God knows what backdoor might be in those)
and need for US services (due to maintenance and training) which will be a great
future investment for the US arms industry (one of the greatest ever), but it
also can be used as an efficient pressure point especially on the so-called
underdeveloped states, i.e. poor countries that probably need these aids the
most, which are also the only states qualified for receiving them.  In fact we
have seen this already happening for Egypt more than once, most
recent in 2022, US withheld $130 million of that military
aid (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_5">Pamuk and Lewis, 2022</a>).
</p>

<p>
Reading (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_3">Gordon, 2010</a>), Joy Gordon tells about what Noam Chomsky
described once as &ldquo;pulverization&rdquo; of 3rd world/undefendable countries that might
step on the US toes:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
These lessons [of war] are directed to several audiences. For the Third World,
the message is simple: Don’t raise your heads. A “much weaker” opponent will not
merely be defeated, but pulverized.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
Indeed the US could make whatever the change they wanted on Iran by running a
coup d&rsquo;etat, something that they have practiced very well for decades (see
(<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">Blum, 2003</a>), a fantastic literature on the subject), but this
would not achieve the pulverization of Iraq.
</p>

<p>
Gordon discusses the brutal methods that the US applied using sanctions to cause
human humanitarian crisis in Iraq. The war casualties is known for most of you,
the <a href="https://youtu.be/KP1OAD9jSaI">500,000 &ldquo;worth it&rdquo; childern</a> and death of millions, however, Gordon
encourages to look upon the &ldquo;invisible war&rdquo; effect, for example it&rsquo;s known that
alliance targeted many schools, hospitals and other civilian targets (on which
the international community would comment &ldquo;nothing serious&rdquo;, of course it&rsquo;s
impossible to get the US into an international court for a war crime, Nicaragua
has done its best on that already) however the sanctions resulted in 30% of Iraq
health institutions to be dysfunctional by 1998, 70% of the population suffered
from anemia and other treatable diseases, the annual death toll of Iraq
increased by hundreds of thousands due to sanctions on drugs imports and lack of
electricity to operate medical equipment (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_3">Gordon, 2010</a>).
</p>

<p>
However, something else got me very interested on Gordon&rsquo;s book: the process of
issuing the security council resolution 661, which was indeed a very critical
decision for a country like Iraq that is known to import most of its needs (70%
by that time).
</p>

<p>
There, the US used sanction and aids as tools to get that resolution passed, as
Gordon states, all the developing countries that voted for the resolution got
many privileges; Egypt, Turkey, China and Jordon got to take their stumbled
loans from the World Bank, and aids were sent to other countries like Colombia,
Ethiopia and Zaire. Of course alliances had more interested in Iraq itself.
</p>

<p>
Yemen was one of the countries that voted against that resolution. As I
mentioned above, countries that voted for it got so many privileges, which tells
us a little about &ldquo;how much is a seat on the Security Council
worth&rdquo; (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_4">Kuziemko and Werker, 2006</a>)? Ilyana Kuziemko and Eric Werker from
Harvard answer in their analysis<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

</p>
<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
We find that a country’s U.S. aid increases by 59 percent and its U.N. aid by 8
percent when it rotates onto the council. This effect increases during years in
which key diplomatic events take place (when members’ votes should be especially
valuable), and the timing of the effect closely tracks a country’s election to,
and exit from, the council.  Finally, the U.N. results appear to be driven by
UNICEF, an organization over which the United States has historically exerted
great control.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
Here the reader can expect what happened to Yemen; &ldquo;That will be the most
expensive ‘no’ vote you ever cast&rdquo; a U.S. diplomat told the Yemeni ambassador
before dropping Yemen&rsquo;s aid, a very poor country suffering from unending wars,
from $70 million to $0.

Sasha Alyson has a fantastic article (<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">Alyson, 2021</a>)
investigating further more on UN-related actions, including U.N. membership and
UNESCO.
