The following is an inverted part from a long note I&rsquo;ve been working on recently
named &ldquo;Notes on Mathematics&rdquo;, however not ready yet to be published (can&rsquo;t be
sure if it will ever be), but I felt the need to publish this part however.
</p>

<p>
It is not so common to have feelings towards one of the most, or actually the most,
abstractive branch of science that ever existed, yet I&rsquo;m always experiencing that
collection of hunting and curiousness feelings whenever I contemplate a beautiful notation
of mathematics, this has been occurring with me more frequently since the last month when
I&rsquo;ve seen the following equation which was posted originally by the <a href="https://twitter.com/infseriesbot/status/1635091916718247937">級数bot</a>:
</p>

<p>
Every time I look at it I imagine the elegance of equations, the harmony of geometric
shapes, for those with the eyes to see, mathematics reveals a glimpse into the very fabric
of the universe itself. It is the very essence of numbers themselves that hold a certain
allure. So let&rsquo;s consider that formula:
</p>

<p>
\[\frac{1}{1^3} - \frac{1}{3^3} + \frac{1}{5^3} - \frac{1}{7^3} + ... = \frac{\pi^3}{32}\]
</p>


<p>
I&rsquo;d like first to talk about how does this work, the subtle interplay of numbers that give
rise to its elegance and precision. At its core, the formula is a representation of the
famous Basel problem, which seeks to find the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of all
positive integers. While this may seem like a daunting task, the formula above provides a
simple yet stunningly effective solution.
</p>

<p>
By manipulating the alternating series of terms, we are able to transform it into a more
manageable form, ultimately arriving at the value of \(\frac{\pi}{32}\) This is accomplished
through a clever use of Fourier series and the Euler-Maclaurin formula, which allow us to
approximate the sum of the infinite series with remarkable accuracy. This clear formula is
more than just a functional tool; it is a symbol of the deep interconnectedness of all
things. It is a reminder that even the most seemingly disparate concepts can be brought
together in a meaningful way, and that through the pursuit of knowledge and truth, we can
experience the profound mysteries of existence. For the great minds of humanity, the
pursuit of truth, knowledge, and beauty were all interconnected aspects of the human
experience. It was through the exploration of these concepts that we were able to connect
with the transcendent nature of reality, and to transcend the limitations of our own
individual perspectives.
</p>


<p>
I don&rsquo;t experience these feelings only in my personal reading and studies, but I also
notice this in some writings, especially from Bertrand Russell writings, actually he says
in his autobiography:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
There was a footpath leading across fields to New Southgate, and I used to go there alone
to watch the sunset and contemplate suicide. I did not, however, commit suicide, because I
wished to know more of mathematics.<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

Allen and Unwin, 1971. p. 66.
</span>
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
While people can imagine it&rsquo;s killing to spend your time doing proofs for things
that were given to you before, they just don&rsquo;t understand the joyfulness. And
notice that I didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;they can not feel it&rdquo;, because I don&rsquo;t really believe
it&rsquo;s possible, and I clearly do not believe that there are people who are
smarter than others so they don&rsquo;t experience these feelings, or as Descartes
puts it:
</p>


<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Those who have this knowledge and awareness of themselves convince themselves
readily that all other human beings can have the same knowledge and awareness of
themselves: because there is nothing in all this that depends on anybody other
than oneself.<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

</span>
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
I&rsquo;m yet not able to find a more precise description better than what Descartes
uses, which is knowledge. Though I can&rsquo;t abstract my feelings towards it at all,
since it&rsquo;s very mixed with nostalgia and appreciations. It&rsquo;s like a blocked
channel in a water flow, or even a minor who can&rsquo;t understand an adult
description of the joyfulness of sex.
</p>

<p>
La Géométrie is one of the most famous examples for that feelings (In which
Descartes is having a similar experience in doing some proofs that he delivered
to his students and us as incomplete.), if you have ever heard of this book,
it&rsquo;s known for being &rsquo;unclear&rsquo;, but actually this was very intended by him when
he said &ldquo;I did not undertake to say everything, in order to give others the
pleasure of discovering [it] for themselves&rdquo;<label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Boyer, Carl B. (2004) [1956], History of Analytic Geometry, Dover. pp. 103-104.
</span> . I&rsquo;ve actually seen this as
recklessness, but I couldn&rsquo;t help imagining myself doing the same thing if I&rsquo;ve
been through very pleasing journey. I really anticipate to be that the reason
why many mathematicians use the infamous &ldquo;the proof is left to the reader as an
exercise&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s an invite to share the joyfulness.
</p>

<p>
It was not merely a tool for understanding the physical world, but rather a
means of exploring the deepest aspects of human consciousness and existence.
