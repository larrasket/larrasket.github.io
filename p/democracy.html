Democracy Criticism

<p>
Or: how democracy spoils everything.
</p>

</div>

<p>
I think everyone should agree that science is not, nor should it be, democratic.
That&rsquo;s probably why science did great in the post-renaissance periods, I
personally believe that the democratic methodology is one of the greatest
differences between the humanities and science. While the humanities do not
embrace any form of democratic methodology, an essence of how democracy works is
implicit in the way the humanities are usually produced.
</p>

<p>
An intuitive example of that is rationality and the refutation of irrationality.
The refutation of irrationality is a very regular activity in doing science,
it’s actually what science is usually defined as (or how I mostly like to define
it): discovering truth by uncovering falsehoods. In the humanities, democracy is
a common thing. It’s the common belief of whatever is there (let it be rational
or irrational).
</p>


<p>
I&rsquo;m not going to criticize democracy here as a political system nor its effects
on academic communities, <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">[1]</a> might give you
some insights on that about the great problems in democracy like rational
ignorance and rational irrationality though, I would like instead to talk about
yet another great issue in democracy, that&rsquo;s: responsibility.
</p>

<p>
Responsibility is also used as a critique of political democracy: no one takes
responsibility for their vote because 1. The fraction of one’s vote is too small
to understand its segmentation, and 2. People are usually manipulated
psychologically through the voting process, some people might change their vote
just because they do not like the candidate&rsquo;s name or haircut, and since there
is no charge of responsibility and since you do not have to legally and
rationally explain why you voted for that candidate, you can do whatever you
like.
</p>

<p>
The tendency to fall for such psychological inclinations rises in situations
like that because no one is paying for their mistakes, no one is going to put
you in jail for choosing the wrong candidate (assuming that everything is so
obvious that the wrongness of one of the candidates can be clearly detected). On
the other hand, if one were to be judged for their choice, they might have spent
much of their time doing research to clarify their vote.
</p>



<p>
So basically, responsibility and rationality have a direct relationship: the
more you are responsible for your vote, the less you are irrational about it.
</p>

<p>
Irrationality does not mean unreasonableness, that’s why we have the public
choice theory that studies rational irrationality. As I mentioned, you might
vote for another candidate just because of reasons that you do not like about
him or things that you believe to be bad about him, but you can not be
scientifically rational about those reasons even if you are certain about them.
For example, let’s say you have some religious belief that makes you believe
that one of that candidate’s campaign promises is unlawful and going to rot the
world. It’s a religion, so you are probably certain about it ; however, if you
can not explain your reasons rationally, it will cause many disputes, so it is
defined here as irrationality.
</p>


<hr>

<p>
Whilst the current genocide in Gaza has been taking a place, Rabea Eghbariah,
Palestinian doctoral candidate at Harvard Law School, submitted a 2,000-word
essay arguing that the assault on Gaza is within the legal framework of
genocide.
</p>

<p>
The draft has been in an undergoing process of publication, the typical academic
process: &ldquo;solicited, commissioned, contracted, submitted, edited, fact checked,
copy edited, and approved by the relevant editors&rdquo; as <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/11/21/harvard-law-review-gaza-israel/">reported</a>.
</p>

<p>
It seems like a focus group call made the Harvard Law Review president urge to
call for an emergency meeting of editors to decide the destiny of the essay: one
of the editors who commissioned the essay, Shahriari-Parsa, &ldquo;and the other top
online editor, Sabrina Ochoa, told The Intercept that they had never seen a
piece face this level of scrutiny at the Law Review&rdquo;.
</p>


<p>
Here I&rsquo;m not interested in giving an example of the constrains on academic
freedom, or freedom in general, especially against Palestinians rights, if you
are interested in that you can find <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">[2]</a> rather
interesting reading (and also check my <a href="freedom.html#0p936gp0kzj0">The Limits on The (allowed) Freedom of
Speech</a>), but instead I wand the reader to contemplate on the method which the
harvard president called for to decide whether the article should be published
or not, do note that the essay perfectly qualifies to be published, as it was
reviewed already:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Following requests from over 30 editors, an emergency meeting of the entire
journal body was called. After nearly six hours, the more than 100 editors voted
anonymously on running the piece or not, with a strong majority voting against
publication.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
Ironically, the book that I just mentioned had a very similar case, not only
similar in the usage of irresponsible, irrational, democracy, but it was also
against a Palestinian-rights defender, Norman Finkelstein: after Alan Dershowitz
continuous accusations and lobbying of DePaul&rsquo;s professors, department
subsequently invited John Mearsheimer and Ian Lustick, two previously uninvolved
academics with expertise on the Israel–Palestinian conflict, to evaluate the
academic merit of Finkelstein&rsquo;s work; they came to the same conclusion
<a href="#citeproc_bib_item_3">[3]</a> that Dershowitz&rsquo;s accusations are based on falsehoods.
However, later DePaul&rsquo;s political science department voted nine to three, and
the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Personnel Committee five to zero, to
give Finkelstein tenure. The three opposing faculty members subsequently filed a
minority report opposing tenure, supported by the Dean of the College, Chuck
Suchar. Not only democracy was wrong used in this example, it was moreover
violated.
</p>

<p>
Back to Eghbariah’s story, I think it’s a great depiction and manifestation of
what I was talking about earlier, how irresponsibility in democracy can lead to
awful choices: the vote was anonymous, no one had to clear any of their
intentions, and no one will be asked to clarify them; no one is responsible for
choosing anything; even the reviewers who initially approved the article
initially (rationally, as that’s their job) can disapprove it by now due to
their political views or whatever, as they can now act ’irrationally’ freely.
</p>

<p>
Irrationality here has reasons (as I mentioned, it does not necessarily have
implicit unreasonableness), probably the same reasons one of them would have
against Palestine or why to be pro-Israeli. Reasons that shall be disputed can
not be introduced as a counterargument to why the essay should not be published,
but they can be introduced as arguments why one’s self thinks that it should not
be published.
</p>

<p>
I will give a final example, suppose you are a Muslim or belong to some ethnic
group that, for some reason, has a very high crime rate, probably due to
historical reasons or poverty; and you have a peer-review work to do on a
statistics project that provides shocking information on how the crime rate is
very high within your group of people. As a peer-reviewer, you will do your
typical job, you might be more skeptical here because you have a motivation, but
this should not change anything if the paper was well written.
</p>

<p>
Now what if you could just vote anonymously to shut down the paper? No questions
asked. This will be great, although it’s dishonest: you know that publishing
such a paper would have a bad effect, and you start to imagine how the media
will use it and link it to racist reasons, how it will be depicted. These are
pretty good reasons not to do your job for but unfortunately, such reasons do not
work in science, the paper should be published if it qualifies to be. Unless you
can provide a clear error in the content, anything you are going to use as a
counterargument will be irrationality.
