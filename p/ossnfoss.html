<p>
The distinction between &ldquo;open source&rdquo; and &ldquo;free software&rdquo; has become more than
an academic debate, it&rsquo;s a battleground for software freedom itself. While these
terms are often used interchangeably, their conceptual differences have created
a dangerous loophole that corporations exploit to appear freedom-friendly while
maintaining restrictive control over their products.
</p>

<p>
The Wikipedia entry for &ldquo;Open-source software movement&rdquo; explicitly warns: &ldquo;Not
to be confused with Free software movement.&rdquo; This distinction matters
profoundly. Software that provides source availability, while certainly superior
to closed-source alternatives, does not automatically guarantee user freedom. The
&ldquo;open source&rdquo; label has become a marketing tool that obscures the more
fundamental question: does this software respect user autonomy and control?
</p>

<p>
Telegram exemplifies this deceptive practice. The company markets itself as
&ldquo;open-source software,&rdquo; yet only portions of its client code are available, and
even that availability is questionable. Compare this to Signal, which provides
complete software freedom: users can examine, modify, and distribute the entire
codebase. Telegram&rsquo;s selective transparency creates an illusion of openness
while maintaining control over critical components.
</p>

<p>
Meta&rsquo;s approach to AI represents perhaps the most sophisticated example of this
deception. The company releases what it calls &ldquo;open source&rdquo; Large Language
Models (LLMs), providing training code to create an appearance of transparency.
However, this selective disclosure conceals the most crucial elements; no
training datasets, no raw data access, no processing scripts, no data samples,
no reproducibility mechanisms. This strategic omission allows Meta to claim
&ldquo;open source&rdquo; credentials while maintaining proprietary control over the
foundation of their AI systems. The community&rsquo;s response celebrating Meta as a
&ldquo;leading AI company&rdquo; for these limited releases demonstrates how effectively
this strategy manipulates public perception.
</p>

<p>
Several major database companies have exploited &ldquo;open source&rdquo; terminology while
fundamentally restricting user freedom, MongoDB pioneered this approach by
switching from the genuinely open AGPL license to their proprietary Server Side
Public License (SSPL). MongoDB submitted the license to the Open Source
Initiative (OSI) for approval in 2018, but the OSI rejected it precisely because
it fails to meet open source standards. Elasticsearch made a similar move in
2021, moving the Open Source portions of Elasticsearch and Kibana source code to
non-OSI approved software licenses, SSPL and Elastic License v2. These
companies continue marketing themselves as &ldquo;open source&rdquo; while using licenses
that explicitly violate open source principles.
</p>

<p>
Companies like GitLab and Nextcloud employ &ldquo;open core&rdquo; models where basic
functionality remains open source, but essential enterprise features require
proprietary licenses. While technically more honest than completely closed
alternatives, this approach fragments software users can examine and
modify basic functions but remain dependent on proprietary components for full
functionality.
</p>

<p>
Corporations selectively release components that appear generous while
withholding elements that would enable true user freedom.
</p>

<p>
Only by maintaining these distinctions can we prevent the complete erosion of
software freedom under the guise of corporate-friendly &ldquo;openness.&rdquo;
