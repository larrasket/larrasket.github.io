I&rsquo;ve been experiencing random impulses of depression lately, perhaps a part of
what&rsquo;s diagnosed as mood swings and mood disorders. While I can not decide
precisely what&rsquo;s going wrong I&rsquo;m trying to do my best to overcome it. I&rsquo;m
sharing my experience here.
</p>

<p>
I know so many literature descriptive anthology pieces about depression,
however, I really like al-Ghazali&rsquo;s:<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Abū Ḥāmid al-Ghazali, Jamīl Ṣalībā (ed), and Kamel Ali, <i>Deliverance from error</i> (Beirut, Lebanon: Dar al-Andalus, 2002), 135.</span>
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
For God put a lock upon my tongue so that I was impeded from public teaching. I
struggled with myself to teach for a single day, to gratify the hearts of the students
who were frequenting my lectures, but my tongue would not utter a single word: I was
completely unable to say anything. As a result that impediment of my speech caused a
sadness in my heart accompanied by an inability to digest; food and drink became
unpalatable to me so that I could neither swallow broth easily nor digest a mouthful of
solid food. That led to such a weakening of my powers that the physicians lost hope
of treating me and said: “This is something which has settled in his heart and crept
from it into his humors; there is no way to treat it unless his heart be eased of the
anxiety which has visited it.”
</p>

<p>
فكنت أُجاهد نفسي أن أُدرس يومًا واحدًا تطييبًا للقلوب المتخلفة إلي، فكان لا ينطق
لساني بكلمة ولا استطيعها البتة، حتى اورثت هذه العقلة في اللسان حزنًا في القلب،
بطلت معاه قوة الهضم ومراءة الطعام والشراب: فكان لا ينساغ لي ثريد، ولا تنهضم لي
لقمة؛ وتعدى إلى ضعف القوى، حتى قطع الأطباء طمعهم من العلاج وقالوا: هذا أمر نزل
بالقلب، ومنه سرى إلى المزاج، فلا سبيل اليه بالعلاج، إلا بأن يتروح السر عن الهم الملم.
</p>

There&rsquo;s always something different in 1st millennium depression literature
(check out Foucault&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of Insanity&rdquo;), perhaps it&rsquo;s the most non-casual
(at least not from an intellectual perspective) form
of depression ever recorded.
</p>

<p>
al-Ghazali depicted later what helped him survive this state, which was
basically Sufism<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Read the Sufism chapter of his book if you are interested in more
details. Also check: <a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/why-a-sufi-approach-to-healing-mental-illness-is-so-powerful?utm_source=rss-feed">Why a Sufi approach to healing mental illness is so powerful</a>
</span>. I think that this approach might not be very helpful.
Not specifically Sufism, but intellectual changes generally
(<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2025-04-19 Sat 14:00]</span></span> although many will argue otherwise)
</p>

<p>
As I mentioned my depression was (is?) swinging, I got the feeling of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
alright now, that was it, it&rsquo;s overcame&rdquo; many times before suffering a next
wave.
</p>

<p>
The latest &ldquo;solution&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve reached so far is routine, and I know that the recipe
I&rsquo;m going to put now is battle-tested because I&rsquo;ve tried it when I was and was
not in depression, that is; not just keeping self busy but with a purpose to get
to the next level.
</p>

<p>
What I&rsquo;ve been doing for example is setting a list of activities to do. I&rsquo;ve a
very (very) long bucket list myself, so it is not really about lacking
organization but doing something at all. The list should be something doable,
easy and not critical, most importantly it should be insulated from anything you
would have in a normal to-do-list (i.e. do not add stuff related to you work,
study or whatever). I believe it should be crowded as well but not too much.
The mere purpose is to keep yourself busy, apparently one of the most naive
advice for depression is the one that seems to work. The tasks need to be
productive, do not add - play a a video game or whatever. Do things that next
morning you will feel good about the fact you have done them.
</p>

<p>
When I get up feeling depressed and awful, I push myself into the list,
simulating to myself that only after finishing this item, this pain is going to
vanish, and  before I even try harder I&rsquo;d be occupied in getting the first item
of the list done. Once I&rsquo;m done with it I reproduce with the next item list, and
so on. By end of the day if I&rsquo;m not feeling better already for all the things
I&rsquo;d have done, I know for certain that I will feel great the next day and I will
have a severe desire to go into the same action list just like the day before.
</p>

<p>
The trade-off here is: 1. You can develop the routine however of your state, if
you feel so good today you do it and if you do not you do it. 2. It produces
something, so even if it does not help healing, at least you are getting things
done (I say productive and depressed is better than unproductive and depressed).

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2024-02-11 Sun 05:38]</span></span> I think this method still works fine after all these
months, perhaps the only thing to focus on more is crisis management.</li>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2024-04-04 Thu 15:34]</span></span> Well for the most part now I can confirm that this
works, empirically.</li>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2024-08-05 Mon 23:08]</span></span> I didn&rsquo;t mention that if you&rsquo;re suffering from some kind of
clinical depression (major depressive disorder) you should seek professional help. I
thought that was too obvious.</li>
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2025-04-19 Sat 14:02]</span></span> Something else that I think I should have mentioned
here is how different it is to have the willing not to be depressed. This is
perhaps the most important step in healing from depression for me, and I
really regret every time I was extremely depressed and decided not to help
myself because I thought it wouldn&rsquo;t make that much of a difference, but it
completely will. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_helps_those_who_help_themselves">God helps those who help themselves</a>. Always help yourself to
get out of depression, like they say, be the one you always wished to have
helping you. If you think having a cup of tea, a good workout, or a walk might
even slightly change your mood, do it. Or even if you don&rsquo;t think it will, but
you believe that you might like it, do it. For me, I found out that doing my
favorite activities that are mostly about me and taking care of myself, and
making sure that I am doing the best for me to have a good time, that was
always the best way for me to get out of depression.</li>
