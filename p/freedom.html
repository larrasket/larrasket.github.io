Freedom of speech has limits, some argue that they must
have<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Gehan Gunatilleke, “Justifying Limitations on the Freedom of Expression,” <i>Human Rights Review</i> 22, no. 1 (November 2020): 91–108, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12142-020-00608-8">https://doi.org/10.1007/s12142-020-00608-8</a>.</span> especially on &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; content that
could be described as &ldquo;harmful and offensive&rdquo;, which is arguable of course. I
call those limits the <i>overt limits</i>, the ones that you might get sued of
criminal speech in many countries.
</p>

<p>
However, there are always the <i>undercover limits</i>, those that you are not likely
to get sued for practicing them, although you are very likely to get (at the very
least) marginalized, defamed and underrepresented. The Nazis used this technique for a
while against the Jews in Germany, it was called the Judenboykott and it was
years before Nuremberg Laws (the antisemitic laws that were enacted in Nazi
Germany), it was a method for marginalizing and underrepresenting the Jews
people without the usage of any kind of law enforcement.<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Bruce F. Pauley, <i>From Prejudice to Persecution: A History of Austrian Anti-Semitism</i> (University of North Carolina Press, 1998).</span>
</p>

<p>
Marginalization and underrepresentationg are indispensable tools for an
oligarchic democracy, or any state that will find a burden for using law
enforcement. It&rsquo;s basically the punishment by the elites to align the view for
the public stackholders (i.e. the people), they should be only exposed to
certain views, this way it will prevent them much from engaging in any
unpleasant actions<label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Noam Chomsky, <i>Media Control: The Spectacular Achievements of Propaganda</i>, 1st ed., The Open Media Pamphlet Series , No 1 (Seven Stories Press, 1997), 24, <a href="https://libgen.li/file.php?md5=83cb03795333049481911669b3f5fe4c">https://libgen.li/file.php?md5=83cb03795333049481911669b3f5fe4c</a>.</span>

<p>
As long as people are marginalized and distracted, [they] have no way to
organize or articulate their sentiments, or even know that others have these
sentiments. People assume that they are the only people with a crazy idea in

</blockquote></div>

<p>
Now this comes on a price: teaching the public the lesson of what happens to
those who are disaligned, they get defamed, marginalized and basically
<i>undercover</i> oppressed and sometimes proscribed.
</p>

<p>
As the time of writing this it has been a few weeks since the beginning of the
Israel-Gaza 2023 war. Compared to clashes that has been going for the past
couple of decades between the Palestinian people and the Israeli forces, that
most recent conflict has been discussed in much bigger scale, many
Israeli-affiliated systems are doing there hard work to make sure that everyone
is having standards of support for Israeli militancy.

<p>

all of the past clashes<label for="4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

Due to that exceptional case of the current conflict, we are seeing that
violation of freedom in much clearer forms and everywhere in public media.

<h2 id="xd74xnp0kzj0">Many CEOs Promoted by Mass Media Are Calling for Blacklist of Harvard Students After Israel Condemnation Statement</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd6c1cc6">
<p>
In 9 Oct 2023 &ldquo;large number of Harvard student organizations&rdquo; made a statement
that&rsquo;s clear about the Israeli conflict. I personally agree with their views,
what happened in 7 October was a consequence of the Israeli actions for the last
couple of decades, killing and oppressing Palestinian whilst running the
greatest open air prison in the world (Gaza).
</p>

<p>
Though this what many CEO did not like, and now they are calling Harvard
university to shut them down, asking for a full list of their names.<label for="10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="10" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Matt Egan, “Ceos Call on Harvard to Name Students Linked to Statement Blaming Israel for Hamas Attack,” <i>Cnn Bussiness</i>, October 2023, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/11/business/harvard-israel-hamas-ceos-students/index.html">https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/11/business/harvard-israel-hamas-ceos-students/index.html</a>.</span> As of the end of October 2023, media has reported
that millions of &rsquo;funds&rsquo; for top U.S. universities are gone due to disaligned

All of these are means for lobbying the universities to either suspend the
students or shut them up somehow (to make sure that only aligned views are
exposed). The suspension of these students or rescinding them from jobs as top
companies are doing both serve as an example of the process of alignment
mentioned on the top of the article.

<h2 id="ysr4rxd0nzj0">Norman Finkelstein Tenure Rejection and Resignation After Debunking Pro-Israeli Book</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5a9b514">
<p>
After the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dershowitz%E2%80%93Finkelstein_affair">Dershowitz–Finkelstein affair</a>, Alan Dershowitz started
campaigned to block Norman Finkelstein tenure bid at DePaul University. His
campaign began in 2004 when he sent DePaul president Dennis Holtschneider a
manuscript, &ldquo;Literary McCarthyism,&rdquo; arguing that the university should fire
Finkelstein. He also contacted DePaul political science department chair
Patrick Callahan.
</p>

<p>
In 2005, Dershowitz announced his intent to block Finkelstein&rsquo;s tenure bid,
saying, &ldquo;I will come at my own expense, and I will document the case against
Finkelstein&rdquo; and &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll demonstrate that he doesn&rsquo;t meet the academic standards
of the Association of American Universities&rdquo;,<label for="13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="13" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Abraham, <i>Out of Bounds: Academic Freedom and the Question of Palestine</i>, 85.</span> sounds like Dershowitz view of being associated with American
Universities implies an ultimate support of Israel<label for="14" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="14" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
As of the time of writing this he has being confirming that, <a href="https://twitter.com/AlanDersh/status/1714635187521192417">calling</a> for
a condemnation of Harvard students who stands against the Israeli actions.
</span>
</p>

<p>
In October 2006, he sent members of DePaul&rsquo;s law and political science faculties
what he called &ldquo;a dossier of Norman Finkelstein&rsquo;s most egregious academic sins,
and especially his outright lies, misquotations, and distortions&rdquo; and lobbied
DePaul&rsquo;s professors, alumni and administrators to deny Finkelstein tenure.<label for="15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="15" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Jennifer Howard, “Harvard Law Professor Works to Disrupt Tenure Bid of Longtime Nemesis at Depaul U.,” <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i>, April 5, 2007, <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/harvard-law-professor-works-to-disrupt-tenure-bid-of-longtime-nemesis-at-depaul-u/">https://www.chronicle.com/article/harvard-law-professor-works-to-disrupt-tenure-bid-of-longtime-nemesis-at-depaul-u/</a>.</span>
</p>

<p>
In May 2007, Dershowitz spoke at Northwestern University and claimed that
Finkelstein had recently attended a Holocaust denial conference in Iran.<label for="16" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="16" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Abraham, <i>Out of Bounds: Academic Freedom and the Question of Palestine</i>, 86.</span>
</p>

<p>
DePaul&rsquo;s political science committee investigated Dershowitz&rsquo;s accusations
against Finkelstein and concluded that they were unsubstantiated. The department
subsequently invited John Mearsheimer and Ian Lustick, two previously uninvolved
academics with expertise on the Israel–Palestinian conflict, to evaluate the
academic merit of Finkelstein&rsquo;s work; they came to the same conclusion.<label for="17" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="17" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Richard Forer, <i>Breakthrough: Transforming Fear into Compassion: A New Perspective on the Israel-Palestine Conflict</i>, 2010.</span>
</p>

<p>
In early 2007, DePaul&rsquo;s political science department voted nine to three, and
the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Personnel Committee five to zero, to
give Finkelstein tenure. The three opposing faculty members subsequently filed a
minority report opposing tenure, supported by the Dean of the College, Chuck
Suchar.
