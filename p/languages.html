Programming incorrectness
</p>

</div>

<p>
First of all I do not like programming languages wars and I believe they are
vastly stupid; every programming language out there had its own views that
matched with feasible many usages. I claim however that some common ways of
designing some languages were not optimal at all, and were indeed influenced by
external forces other than the ideality of the design (corporate interests is a
widely acknowledged example).
</p>

<p>
My main use case for a programming language regular software engineering,
although sometimes I do scientific computing, most programming languages out
there fit for my &rsquo;scientific&rsquo; needs. My favorite language for scientific
computing currently is Julia, my favorite language generally is <a href="../cs/go.html#lvkhzyo02wj0">Go</a>. The
following table shows the aspect that I consider when I pickup a programming
language for my need. I will only list the language I know and tried.

Side notes:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Common Lisp: Although the programming language itself does not suggest any
method to manage packages, the community of CL programmers is heavily inclined
into using the quicklisp utility to manage packages, see <a href="#g5tg5e01qxj0">Programmers can make languages horrible</a>
and <a href="#uau7ou11qxj0">Centralized Package Repository</a> sections.</li>
<li>Julia: You still can install packages directly from a git repository that is
out of the Julia registry. See <a href="https://julialang.org/contribute/developing_package/#step_5_register_your_package">How to develop a Julia package</a>.</li>
<li>Go: There is no an officially supported REPL for Go, however, the
<a href="https://github.com/cosmos72/gomacro">cosmos72/gomacro</a> totally covers it up.</li>
<li>Rust:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The package Julie note applies here too.</li>
<li>There are implementation for Rust REPLs, however non of them are fast enough
to call them usable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>C:  Although there is the <a href="http://www.artificialworlds.net/wiki/IGCC/IGCC">IGCC</a>, the unmanaged nature of C makes it reckless to

<h2 id="x0z0fu11qxj0">Exception handling</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdb4d2a4">
<p>
Some of the features that I look for are obvious; however some of them might be
questionable for other people, for example people who have been using C#/Java
for all of their life would be surprised that someone does not like exceptions,
this is like saying <code>if</code> statements are harmful.
</p>

<p>
However, this is only because this is what people used to engage with, but when
you think carefully about exceptions you can see that in their essences they are
nothing different than GOTO calls (which you rarely find someone nowadays
question them being considered harmful), actually one might consider arguing
about some <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/11065448">benefits</a> over using GOTO calls sometimes; but if you deeply
compare GOTO with exceptions, you will see how terrible exceptions are, that
is, they include only the bad parts of GOTOs. There
is a type of GOTO calls that was just bad that no body talks about, and it was
actually the one from which all this hate emerged against GOTO calls, that&rsquo;s
BASIC&rsquo;s GOTO. C-like GOTOs are much more constrained compared to the former, yet
if you compare both to exceptions, exceptions are akin to classical BASIC&rsquo;s
GOTOs. Since I do not like this post to be transferred into a &ldquo;case against the
exception handling&rdquo;, I&rsquo;d recommend reading the following; Edsger W. Dijkstra&rsquo;s
<a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD215.PDF">A Case against the GOTO statement</a> with exception handling in mind (i.e. replace
every occurrence of GOTO with try catch throw) and reading Dave Cheney&rsquo;s
<a href="https://dave.cheney.net/2012/01/18/why-go-gets-exceptions-right">Why Go gets exceptions right</a>.
</p>

<p>
I like to mention that my first programming language was C/C++. Then I learned
C#, which I still believe is a very nice language (I will try to discuss it
later here). When I learned C# for the first time and I shot myself in the foot
I experienced exceptions for the first time. I was really surprised by how
errors were being handled, I felt something really strange: it could not be that
naive. Of course I did not tell myself that because what I did in C (which was
just a variable passed by reference indicates whether everything is alright,
like the Go way, the way I prefer: simple) was actually no error handling at
all. I told myself it might be a screwed way of designing the language but I
tried just to get adapted to it (like probably everyone did) once I discovered
that this is the way to handle errors in many other languages as well; think
about this flow, you are using a library that uses set of other libraries, it
does set of complicated scenarios, including using multiple http clients,
intensive writing/reading operation on the file system, high memory usage, etc..
</p>

<p>
Now each of these might have many factors contributing a failure, the http
client might have an issue during the early initialization due to inadequate
memory or something (actually any other possible reasons), the file system might
return an error code because of mismatching/unsafe/unsatisfying permissions, or
it might be full, it might be busy, and so on and so forth: too many
possibilities, computers are complex.
</p>

<p>
In exception handling, you can just use a single outer catch to all these
scenarios:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org8aa22da">
// in your main function:
try
{
  //  start your program here
}

// genaric type to catch
// any possible exceptions
// inherits this class
//        ^
//        |
catch (Exception e)
{
  //  Block of code to handle errors
  // some debuging flags here
  System.SoyFriendly.SoyendFriendlyMessageToUser("sorry bro something went wrong")
}

</pre>

<p>
However, a sophisticated software developer will have many exception handling
for cases like the ones I mentioned above; like memory and network errors. The
problem here is, there is no way the developer can handle all possible
exceptions<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Some language designer had the decision to make their STD never throw
exceptions, however the majority of languages that use exception use it in their
STDs too. This makes the number of the possible exception very huge.
</span>  so they are going only to fix things that either their user
will report them later with some logs, or things that are obvious to occur
(network errors are likely to happen for example).
</p>

<p>
This makes the use of that outer <code>try..catch</code> inevitable unless you do not care
about the user experience. This engenders many possible scenarios that might
have been manageable by the programmer to get out till they add it to their
handled exceptions in some new versions. What is the alternative? the programmer
should (or must) handle all the possible cases, which is the case with some new
languages like Go and Rust.

<div id="outline-container-uau7ou11qxj0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="uau7ou11qxj0">Centralized Package Repository</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga99d827">
<p>
This is not a major issue, but it is very annoying in my opinion, which is just
as common as exception handling or even more. I think that people will consider
it very soon as the internet is moving more towards decentralization and
distribution.  You can see the issue of centralization when you look at the
number of &ldquo;please&rdquo;s in their repository <a href="https://github.com/quicklisp/quicklisp-projects/issues?q=is%3Aissue+please">quicklisp/quicklisp-projects</a>. The
<a href="https://ultralisp.org/">Ultralisp Repository</a> tries to resolve this issue for the Common Lisp programming
language.
</p>

<p>
However this issue of &ldquo;approving&rdquo; packages is not common (yet)<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
I think it starts to be a little common with Julia, though the language
makes it very easy to install package directly from any git repository, just
like Go does.
</span> , I used to
use nuget and I used cargo and both are actually very okay to use, yet there are
0 guarantee that they are going to stay like that or even that they will
&rsquo;behave&rsquo; right. This is because the maintainers have the whole absolute power,
can we be sure that Microsoft will not add some 0.3$ subscription to be able to
use nuget? Can we be sure that Mozilla maintainers will not decide that
programming is bad and just dropout cargo for good? Will all of these
possibilities have very low likelihood, however, there is a very important
lesson that all of you might have learned from software design: we never trust,
we constrain; you wouldn&rsquo;t give your user all permissions and trut them that
they are faithful nice people.
</p>

<p>
This is the cause with centralized package repositories, we have nothing but to
trust the maintainers who have all the power, if they do not put restrictions
already on who is going add his package or why (like quicklisp does), no one can
guarantees that they do not misconduct due to whatever reason towards some
package. Remember the <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/11/03/Rust-1.65.0.html">Rust 1.65.0 Announcement</a>? When the Rust team added some
political correctness spices to their release note about the Mahsa Amini
incident. Well what will be their reaction to a package in cargo that all it
does is printing some pro-Irani propaganda about the deceased? There should be
no one to supervise whether X is right or wrong in programming environments.

<p>
I think last 2 sections elaborate in the most 2 controversial things in my view,
though unlike <a href="#uau7ou11qxj0">Centralized Package Repository</a>, I do not think that <a href="#x0z0fu11qxj0">Exception
handling</a> is ultimately bad, still I think it should not be allowed. This also
applies to things like macros and inheritance.
</p>

<p>
Common Lisp is the most language that I think the following applies to it.
Actually I want you to have a look at <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37209654">this</a> post from Hacker News:
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org2d889fa">
I thought Lisp was suppose to be simple in that: it's all just lists.

I thought everything would just be s-expressions, and be consistent, so it would be
easy to read to figure out what is going on.

But it seems like there are so many special constructs and macros, that make it hard
to read. And behind the scenes of these macros it gets really complicated. Whereas in
other languages its readable the whole way down.

E.g. How am I suppose to read this? How does it de-construct to s-expressions...and
does it even? What is implemented natively in the interpreter? Does that language
have built-in keywords?

I thought everything was suppose to be like: `(left . (left . right) )`.

    (loop for i in '(1 2 3)
        when (&gt; i 1)
        return i)
It seems as if there are actually a ton more special case primitives I need to know,
when I could get away with a lot less syntax in other languages to be productive.

Like maybe there is some simplicity at the very bottom, but that doesn't seem to
matter in day-to-day programming.

Another example, the first think I see when I look at the language basics of how to
make a function:

https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/functions.html:

    (defun  (list of arguments)
      "docstring"
      (function body))
How do I read this as an s-expression?
</pre>

<p>
Want I want you to notice here is the macro part (loop for), this macro was very
controversial back in the day, many people believed that it is not &ldquo;lispy
enough&rdquo; to be used, however, it was &ldquo;ok&rdquo; since it was &ldquo;up to you to use it or
not&rdquo;, and it ended up being a part of the common lisp implementation.
</p>

<p>
Another thing to mention is that I&rsquo;m one of the people who believe that
inheritance is pretty much okay, even multiple inheritance actually which I used
to use in C++ sometimes, however, you might have noticed that I really do not
like to use languages that do support inheritance
</p>

<p>
This applies to another thing in Common Lisp, the Common Lisp Object System
(CLOS) which implements the old (hesitated to add &rsquo;good&rsquo;) classical OOP. I
believe that it is one of the greatest things about Common Lisp, but what I&rsquo;ve
always and always noticed, that people are really, really abusing it badly,
seems applies to inheritance, multiple inheritance and exceptions.
</p>

<p>
Back in the day when I was learning programming for the first time, in C++, and
I learned that many languages adds restrictions on things like multiple
inheritance and even inheritance, I asked myself: why? I mean, well they are
nice things it should be up only to the programmer to decide when to use it or
not.
</p>

<p>
This is still true, however, when you think about your experience in the
software industry, you understand how much consideration of the community
matters as well.
</p>

<p>
Some reason that I recall for my experience with JavaScript was very bad, was
that unlike other languages that I used back in the day, JavaScript had many, so many
incomplete developers who just came from some twitter hips and whatnot. Why
does this matter? Well, many times you are going to use packages and libraries
that this community did build. Here is it: in the modern software industry, the
community surrounding a programming language actually matters too.
</p>

<p>
And this what happened with language allowing inheritance, exceptions, GOTOs,
and the like, people just abused it and the language became very horrible to
use because many packages became badly written.
