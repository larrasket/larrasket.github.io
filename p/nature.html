I wrote multiple times about René Descartes&rsquo;s <a href="anthology_of_les_passions_de_l_ame.html#3wacz0q02wj0">Les Passions de l&rsquo;âme</a>, perhaps the
most pivotal piece of philosophy that I&rsquo;ve encountered thus far. In essence,
this treatise is s about the comprehension of emotions, their origins, and the
appropriate manner in which to respond to them. Descartes didn&rsquo;t know much of
neuroscience back then nonetheless he provides an acceptable assertion about
where does feelings come from. I think this understanding is being
underappreciated, although its significance is paramount for achieving
self-mastery and self-realization; in many times times, people over rely on
their emotions. Nietzsche talked about this too:<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, <i>The Dawn of Day</i>, ed. J. M. Kennedy (Dover Publications, 1998).</span>

Would you really trust your feelings?
</p>

</div>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
FEELINGS AND THEIR DESCENT FROM JUDGMENTS.—“Trust in your feelings!” But
feelings comprise nothing final, original; feelings are based upon the judgments
and valuations which are transmitted to us in the shape of feelings
(inclinations, dislikes).  The inspiration which springs from a feeling is the
grandchild of a judgment—often an erroneous judgment!—and certainly not one&rsquo;s
own judgment! Trusting in our feelings simply means obeying our grandfather and
grandmother more than the gods within ourselves: our reason and experience.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
Feelings serve as an intermediary mechanism to align with the dictates of mother
nature, but they do not necessarily reflect what is genuinely beneficial for us.
A prime illustration of this concept lies in the revulsion we experience when
confronted with something deemed &rsquo;disgusting,&rsquo; such as urine. This aversion is
indeed quite comprehensible and innate, as many of the things we find repulsive
often serve as carriers of harmful bacteria which have potential risk of
infection. It is noteworthy to observe how we are subtly conditioned to feel
differently in certain situations; for instance, mothers tend to exhibit less
disgust towards their own babies&rsquo; diapers compared to those of other
infants.<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Trevor I. Case, Betty M. Repacholi, and Richard J. Stevenson, “My Baby Doesn’t Smell as Bad as Yours: The Plasticity of Disgust,” <i>Evolution and Human Behavior</i> 27, no. 5 (2006): 357–65, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2006.03.003">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2006.03.003</a>.</span>  This adaptive response is advantageous as it
enables mothers to care for their children more effectively without being overly
discomforted by feelings of disgust. Nonetheless, this raises an important
question: are these things truly intrinsically disgusting?, or does their
perceived disgust emerge from our social conditioning and evolutionary
adaptations?
</p>


<p>
Another case can be observed in our aversion towards certain insects, such as
cockroaches, primarily driven by their appearance and association with
parasitism. However, let&rsquo;s ask the question contemplating the actual extent of
harm that a cockroach can inflict upon us compared to other creatures with which
we delight in interacting, like cats and dogs, despite the latter not being
domesticated.
</p>


<p>
I noticed that seizures inducing ejaculation becoming increasingly prevalent in
rabbits, I couldn&rsquo;t help but notice that some male rabbits even die after mating
with females. We cannot question the consciousness to rabbits to question such
behaviors, as their level of awareness does not enable them to process facts or
anticipate consequences. Nevertheless, this should make us question own
judgments. How likely is it that male humans would engage in similar behavior if
existed and felt so good (just like sex does)?  To question the validity of our
own actions. Many things that we perceive as immensely pleasurable may only be
so because our emotions lead us to believe so, without necessarily aligning with
what is genuinely good or beneficial in the grand scheme of things.
