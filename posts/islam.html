There is that Quranic expression from Bara'ah: He layeth his foundation [constructing] on an
undermined sand-cliff, it is ready to crumble to pieces with him (Arabic:  أَسَّسَ بُنْيَانَهُ عَلَىٰ
شَفَا جُرُفٍ هَارٍ فَانْهَارَ بِهِ فِي نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ), a lot of arguments are based on such a "undermined sand
cliff" which is really ready to crumble but the 'argumenter' doesn't give a lot of attention
of this, and he prolong, decorate and fortify his argument until the point it becomes a
book: hundreds of page based on some inexact arguments.
</p>

<div class="PREVIEW" id="orga294ea6">
<p>
There are a lot of examples of this, American creationists exert a lot of efforts based on
false beliefs, they even created a fully so called 'scientific journal' called
<i><a href="https://bio-complexity.org/ojs/index.php/main">biocomplexity</a></i> which tries to prove that bio-objects are too complicated to be created by a
blind watch maker. This is led by the misunderstanding to every evolutionary fact, all of
the creationists claims however in how many pages it is descried, it is probably can be
refuted in a few paragraphs which might sounds insanity to someone who watching this happens
from afar.

Some chapters in Dr. Hoodbhoy's, a Pakistani nuclear physicist, book are very
applicable to this.

<p>
They can be categorized by 5 kinds:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The nature of science and the history of the definition of science (Chapters 2, 3).</li>
<li><p>
The "state" of the "Islamic" science in the new world (Chapters 4, 12 and 5)
</p>

<p>
   Which in he ignores the political turmoil behind anything that happens in the Middle
East (the overwhelm of what he calls the Islamic World).
</p></li>
<li><p>
A historical background (Chapter 10).
</p>

<p>
    More pierces a horrible historical background in which he tries to establish an
constructing for the phantom war between "Science and Islam" by claiming that this war
has been forever between the top Islamic scientist, the figures of the Islamic
Renaissance: Ibn Rushd, Ibn Sina, AL-Kidi, AL Razi, AL Kindi and Ibn-Khaldoun, he ignores
every historical event in their lives.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Mockery on many ignorant who claims to do science (and he designate it to Islamic Science) (Chapter 12)
</p>

<p>
     Hoodbohy makes a very good use of straw man arguments, for instance in chapter 5
"Three Muslims Responses to Underdevelopment" he chooses carefully the most lunatic
responses to laugh on and refute.
</p></li>

<li>Sterile discussion on the nature of Islamic science (Chapters 1, 7 and 9)</li>
</ol>

<p>
This article probably will not be another response from the Islamic science proponents, but
a critique of facts Hoodbhoy ignored especially the historical facts in chapter 10 <i>Five
Great Heretics</i>. I will try to put on my views of faith and science in a conclusion.

<div id="outline-container-org11782a6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org11782a6">The Forth Muslim Response to Underdevelopment</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org11782a6">
<blockquote>
<p>
The mushrooming of fundamentalist Islamic movements in the 1970s and 1980s is its most
concrete manifestation. From nominally secular Egypt to the Wahabi Islamic Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia, from the revolutionary Shi'ite state of Ayatollah Khomenei to the Islamic Republic
of Pakistan, <b>the trumpets call incessantly for Holy War!</b>. <i>Holy War</i> against the <span class="underline">secular</span>,
rationalist and universalist ideal. <i>Holy War</i> against capitalism, socialism, and communism
alike. <i>Holy War</i> to establish one or other vision of an ideal Islamic state. <i>Holy War</i> to
fight against the principle - first enunciated by the Arab (and Muslim) philosopher <b>Ibn
Rushd</b> some 800 years ago - that human reason is the only instrument which should be allowed
to guide human society. And Holy War against the foundations of modern, secular, scientific
thought and method.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This proem states the main problem with the book: the complete historical frame of all these
events is being ignored. for instance the slump of the Arabic nationality and secular
movements in the Arab world, which always had been on a feud with the Muslims Brotherhood
(MB henceforth), one of the main causes of the re-rise of Islamic fundamentalism in the Arab
world, and it's also one of the most influential on Jamaat e-Islami<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup> which Hoodbhoy
designates as partition of the 'restorationism line', who knows how it would go if Israel
did not exist to kill the core of Arab secularism in Egypt (Gamal Abdelnasser<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>) so he
could continue to put pressure on them, or even if there were no Saddat to fund Islamists in
Egypt to defend communism and left-wing, if the U.S. didn't fund all these pro-wahhabi
movements in the 80s-90s, Saudi Arabia alike.
</p>

<p>
There is a lot of consequential events that led to where we are today, all of it is not
really related to Islam rather than the Middle East and its politica unrest, actually we
will observe that this is mostly the main reason of the phantom war between science and
Islam in the following paragraphs.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Hoodbhoy used in his book what I can name the most lunatic 'responses' to refute from
Jammat e-Islam, which thinks that "All modernist ideologies are characterized by man
worship. Man worship most often appears under the guise of science. Modernists are convinced
that progress in scientific knowledge will eventually confer upon them the powers
of Divinity."<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup> as Maryam Jameelah, a spokeperson of it, puts. Also its founder thinks
that "geography, physics, chemistry, biology, zoology. geology and economics are taught
without reference to Allah and his Messenger and are hence a source of gumrahi (straying
from the truth)"<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5" role="doc-backlink">5</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
So I'm going to skip the three <i>restorationist, reconstructionist, pragmatist</i> lines, because
they don't really represent a response to the underdevelopment.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org482df63" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org482df63">Jamal al-Din al-Afghani and Hussine Fahmy</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org482df63">
<p>
However, Hoodbhoy began to establish the phantom war between science and Islam in this
chapter, in The Prgamist line speaking of Shiekh Gamal El Dine Al Afghani
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In 1870 Afghani was expelled from Istanbul under pressure from the clergy. His crime was the
advocacy of a Darul-Funun, a new university devoted to the teaching of modern science.<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="#fn.6" role="doc-backlink">6</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Hoodbhoy qoutes this event from An Islamic Response to Imperialism Political and Religious
Writings of Sayyid Jamal ad-Din al-Afghani by Nikki R. Keddie, which is not really a
biography, however Keddie himself said about this event that "no text of the talk seems to
exist"<sup><a id="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7" role="doc-backlink">7</a></sup> and he refuses to take Muhammad Abdo's, who had been there, testimony because
it is 'possibly doctored' he says. Here is the story from a copy of Abdo's testimony<sup><a id="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8" role="doc-backlink">8</a></sup>:
</p>

<p>
And after sex months in AlMa'raef Majles, Afghani had been straightforward and righteous, and
he sought to the popularization of Al Maraef, which would <b>deduct</b> a lof from <i>Hussin Fahmy's</i>,
<span class="underline">Imam of Istanbul</span> then, money, so <b>he was mad on Afghani</b>.
</p>

<p>
And in Ramadan 1287 hāʾ, Dar Al Funoon president asked Afghani to give a speech to talk
about industries, Afghani refused because his Turkey wasn't good enough, but Tahseen Afandy
insisted so Afghani wrote the speech and showed it to Sawfat Basha, the minister of Al
Ma'araef then and a lof of other representatives of Istanbul [See all the names in the
original text] and all of them liked it.
</p>

<p>
Afghani compared industry with some biological organs and faith, and in somehow Hussen
Fahmy, the Imam who had in fuel with Afghani before, interpreted it as Afghani was sayign
that "Al Nubwa" (means Allah's revelation) is a kind of industry so in somehow he says that
the Prophet was just a cleaver literal and the result is he must be Kafer.
</p>

<p>
Fahmy went to the preachers in Istanbul, and as powerful cleric he threatened them to spear
the publicity that Afghani spears disbelief and blasphemy.
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026;]
</p>

<p>
I think it's clear now why Fahmy was the only one to be mad of Afgani's speech however the
overwhelm of Istanbul representatives liked it, because he was mad on him since the
popularization of Al Maraef, it was not a muslim response to Afghani because he talked about
science otherwise he would had been expelled from all countries he had visited.

<div id="outline-container-org3d9b3fa" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org3d9b3fa">Underdevelopment in The New Arab World</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3d9b3fa">
<p>
Lots of modern literature tried to re-explain the underdevelopment in the Arab world (e.g.
Cammett, Melani. 2018) to a lot of reasons like the modern colonial heritage or even
corruption. The question of underdevelopment might be discussed further in the future in this
blog, however, I'd like to talk in brief about it.
</p>

<p>
Hoodbhoy believes, like me, that the overwhelming majority of people in the Islamic world are
being satisfied by the belief of the pragmatist line: "pragmatist  Muslims still form the
majority. The electoral defeats of the fundamentalist  parties in several Muslim countries
strongly suggest that most Muslims will not  accept fundamentalist versions of the Faith
when there is an alternative"<sup><a id="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9" role="doc-backlink">9</a></sup>. However, this put him in a contradiction: as the most
of people are not fundamentalists, and there are some countries without an underdevelopment
issues (The U.A.E, Qater, etc..), why we can't remark science in these countries?
</p>

<p>
We can give a lot of arbitrary social reasons, for example, the majority of people that live
in a country like the U.A.E might not be interested even in doing science, the U.A.E people
have been in tribes to the last century, they are new to things like schools and university,
it's very discursive that they won't be interested in science like other peoples. These
countries are just out from either long colonial eras or a long marginalization: even during
the Abbasid and Ottoman Caliphate, these countries wasn't an interest to any of the ruling
powers.
</p>

<p>
This is applicable to any of what Abdul Rahman Munif calls "Cities of Salt", for instance,
try to guess when the first university in Suadi Arabia was established? It is not even more
than 100 years ago, it was about in 1950, U.A.E had its first university in 1976.
</p>

<p>
In the other side, the countries with more articulate history in science (e.g. Egypt, Syria,
Lebanon and Iraq) are suffering from political upheavals in the daily basis Lebanon is going
through an endless crisis, and it does not emerge from one war unless it enters another.
Egypt and Iraq are going through two phases that are the worst in their history. 30% of
people are under poverty threshold in the official statements in Egypt, such a people
shouldn't be every interested in doing science.

<div id="outline-container-org18bd5c5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org18bd5c5">Five Great 'Heretics'</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org18bd5c5">
<p>
In this chapter Hoodbhoy gives us examples of the <i>holy</i> insane war between Islamic
fundamentalists and science, he gives five examples, five heretics: Al-Kindi AI-Kindi
(801-873), AI-Razi (865-925), Ibn Sina (980-1037), Ibn Rushd (1126-1198) and Ibn-Khaldun
(1332-1406). I have not studied Islamic philosophy before, but I'm pretty sure Hoodbhoy
doesn't know a lot of those philosophers' history nor their history.
</p>

<p>
The main argument in this chapter here is that the following scientists had been accused of
disbelief.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org37235d7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org37235d7">Al-Kindi (801-873)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org37235d7">
<p>
I'm glad that Hoodbhoy started with Al-Kindi, because his story is the most retable to my
argument that most of Islamic philosophers and scientists who had been accused by disbelief,
wasn't accused for a religious view rather a political issue with the governor (Khalifa).
</p>

<p>
Hoodbhoy designates Al-Kindi to be a one of Mu'tazilite, which is inaccurate, there is no
any evidence that Al-Kindi was one of them, in fact, there is a very rare books about him in
the current time, Islamic historian are not even sure about his pervious religion before he
converted to Islam as the Islamic historian Abu'l-Hasan Bayhaqi says:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
And they weren't sure of Al-Kindi, some people said he was a Jewish then he converted to
Islam, and others said he was christian.<sup><a id="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10" role="doc-backlink">10</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
You can find a lot of funny stories about Al-Kindi with Abu Tamam and other writers, but
there is a story that you will find only in Hoodbhoy's book:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
In the court of AI-Mamun, AI-Kindi was a star who shone bright in the
foremost cultural centre of the world. His academic pursuits maintained their
vigour in the subsequent reign of the rationalist Caliph al-Mutassim, and then
of al-Wathiq. But then came the ascendancy of the orthodox Sunni Caliph
AI-Mutawwakil, and with it the end of a long period of liberalism. It was not
hard for the ulema to convince the ruler that the philosopher had very
dangerous beliefs. Mutawwakil soon ordered the confiscation of the scholar's
personal library, known to all Baghdad as al-Kindiyah. But that was not
enough. The sixty-year-old Muslim philosopher also received fifty lashes
before a large crowd which had assembled. Observers who recorded the event
say the crowd roared approval with each stroke.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What a sad fake story, sadly I couldn't examine Hoodbhoy's reference here, he says in the
footnotes that it is <i>The Genius of Arab Civilization</i> by J. R. Hayes, which is not
available at all, however, after I searched in mostly  all Islamic historic book that
mentioned AL-Kindi, I can insure by 99% that this is an inaccurate story.
</p>

<p>
At least not the part of that the fundamentalist Mutawwakil that order to give the
philosopher 50 lashes because he had been a very bad philosopher.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless the part about his issue with Al Mutawwakil and specially the classification of
his library did happnen, but not for the reasons that Hoodbhoy assumes. The islamic
historian  Ibn Abi Usaybi'a tells us the full story in his book Lives of the Physicians
['Eyoun Al Inbaa' fi Tabiqt Al Atibaa']<sup><a id="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11" role="doc-backlink">11</a></sup>:
</p>

<p>
Al-Kindi had been on feud with Banū Mūsā, a family group of scientists and engineers who served the
caliphs on the royal court along side with Al-Kindi, however, Al-kindi was the most one of
them to be closer to the Caliphate which Banū Mūsa didn't like very much so they told him
that Al kinndy "criticizes you politically and spreads disbelief" then, Al-Mutwakkel orderd
to classify all of Al-Kindi books and put it somewhere called "Al Maktaba Al Kindiah" where
Banū Mūsā studied it.
</p>

<p>
The way that some friend of Al-Kindy manged to get back his library happned as the
following: Al Mutawkel wanted to build a Dam, he orded Banū Mūsā to take the responsibility
of it, unfortunately they falied him and all of them were about to die (as they destroyed
many many resources and materials, they were sure that Al Mutawkeel was going to kill them
all), so they rushed to Sanad ibn Ali, one of the best engineers ever in the Islamic world
and Al-Kindi best friend then. Ali was aware of Banū Mūsā's plan to bring Al-Kindi down, so
he required them to bring Al-kendy's library back again to him otherwise he wouldn't help.
And this is how Al-Kindy got his library back.
</p>

<p>
Thankfully some historians had written about how Al-Kindy dead, and it doesn't have anything
to do with the sad fiction story that he "couldn't recover from the ordeal of the public
flogging". ‘Alī ibn Yūsuf al-Qifṭī says in his popular book "The biographies and the books
of the great philosophers":
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
And Abu 'Yaqoub [Refers to al-Kindi] had a problem with drinking, and he had repent of it
lately and started to drink Sharab Al Asal [means the honey drink, I'm not sure what is it],
which clotted in his blood, so he dead<sup><a id="fnr.12" class="footref" href="#fn.12" role="doc-backlink">12</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
This is all about Al-Kindi, as I said their was no evidence that he was one of Mu'tazilite,
actually Hoodbhoy gives an example of his Mu'tazilitism by saying that he interpret a verse
from Quran 'rationally':
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
  To give an example of the allegorical reasoning that AI-Kindi believed in,
consider verse L V5 of the Qur'an. In this passage, the believer is told that the
sun, moon, stars, mountains, trees and beasts 'bow themselves' before God.
For the unsophisticated, this invokes an image wherein all creation literally
bends in prayer. But AI-Kindi gave an elaborate linguistic argument that the
Arabic word for 'bow' should be understood as meaning 'obey'. Thus, the
naive picture of universal worship should instead be understood as the
universal obedience to God's will.<sup><a id="fnr.13" class="footref" href="#fn.13" role="doc-backlink">13</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I'm not sure where Hoodbhoy read this, as I said I couldn't a digital format of his source,
but anyway this is not a rational interpretion at all rather a regular one. Give a look at
Al-Baghawi's Taffsir, and hi is a one of the top fundamentalists in Islam:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The prostration was said that it was in the sense of obedience, for there is no inanimate
object that isnot obedient to God, submissive, and has a glorifying one for him<sup><a id="fnr.14" class="footref" href="#fn.14" role="doc-backlink">14</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgfdc8565" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgfdc8565">Averroes, <i>Ibn Rushed</i> (1126-1189)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgfdc8565">
<p>
Hoodbhoy says:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Ibn Rushd, as Qazi of Seville and later Cordova, became the victim of political
intrigues and a target for the orthodoxy. When the Caliph Abu Yaqub died in
1184, and was succeeded by his son Abu Yusuf, Ibn Rushd soon fell out of
favour. A prohibition was issued against the study oflogic and science by order
of the Caliph. Ibn Rushd was eventually banned from Cordova and was
unceremoniously carted off to a small provincial town together with other
students of philosophy. All his books, except for some strictly scientific ones,
were ordered burnt. It was only towards the end of the 12th century that he was
restored to favour, and returned to Marrakesh to die<sup><a id="fnr.15" class="footref" href="#fn.15" role="doc-backlink">15</a></sup>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I'm speechless in correcting this, I have no choice so I'll translate subchapter from Ibn
Rušd biography<sup><a id="fnr.16" class="footref" href="#fn.16" role="doc-backlink">16</a></sup> .
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A lot ot translated books tried to guess the reasons of Averroes' catastrophe, and all of it
is nothing but guesses attempt to discover the real accusation that Averroes was sued for.
It was "Things in his books, it was said that it was written by his own hands" and one of
these "things" is that he descried the giraffe in his book "The Animal" and said "I've seen
it in the royal court of Barber kind" which frustrated Khalifa Abd al-Muʾmin al-Manṣūr of
him, and this funny story continues and make up that Averroes tried to apologist for that,
and he said to al-Manṣūr that he meant king of Birin<sup><a id="fnr.17" class="footref" href="#fn.17" role="doc-backlink">17</a></sup> not of Barbr but the reader
confused it with barbar.
</p>

<p>
And this is completly false story, as The Animal Book was written in Sevilla in 565 hāʾ, as
Averroes said himself, it was when he was a judge for Abi Youssef Y'qoub, about 6 years
before al-Manṣūr governess, and 15 years before the court.
</p>

<p>
[&#x2026;]
</p>

<p>
However, the writer of Mu'jab<sup><a id="fnr.18" class="footref" href="#fn.18" role="doc-backlink">18</a></sup> that we made a use of before, suggested two reasons: one great
and the other cryptic and it is the main reason, he says "It was the great antagonism of
al-Manṣūr because Averroes didn't served him in the best way that a Khalifa used to be
served with" and he mention the giraffe story which, as we mentioned above, is very
inaccurate and has a lot of contradictions. And the 'cryptic' reason (the main one) is
because Averroes said that Venus is a god, and we excluded this possibility because it isn't
relatable to him at all.
</p>

<p>
We have only two possibilities try to understand the reason of the catastrophe:
</p>

<p>
One of them is that it was a pretext, and the main reason —indirect reason— is Manṣūr's
aversion to Averroes because Averroes used to tell him that his behaviour is not
inappropriate to a king, and what was said the Cordoba philosopher wasn't complimenting him
enough, instead he used to talk to him like "listen to me, my brother!".
</p>

<p>
And the second one is what historians were unanimous on, that people of Cordoba didn't like
Averroes at all because he had been better than them, they envied and competed with him in
the proximity to the Khalifa. [&#x2026;]
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Al-Jabri after that continues to explain the reason that he think is the real one, and it is
a book on politics, in which Ibn Rushd appears criticize the rule of al-Mansur. You can
observe the following: There is no any exist of a war between orthodox fundamentalists
and a rationalist Averroes but three possibilties:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Averroes criticized al-Manṣūr policy in his book of politics.</li>
<li>People of Cordoba made up an affliction between Ibn Rushd and al-Manṣūr by deliberately misunderstanding his words on Venus.</li>
<li>The Caliph punished Ibn Rushd because he did not praise him well.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="org2427d33">Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2427d33">
<p>
Hoodbhoy says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It is a sad commentary on the state of Muslim scholarship that Ibn Khaldun
remained a virtual nonentity until he was discovered by Orientalists. Now that
he has their stamp of recognition, many scholars - excepting Arab racialists
and the extreme orthodox - have entered into a competition to see whose
encomiums are the loudest.<sup><a id="fnr.19" class="footref" href="#fn.19" role="doc-backlink">19</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It seems that Hoodboy couldn't find anything about the infidelity of Ibn Khaldoun, as he was
loved by most of people in his ages, even by fundamentalists in our days, I don't know who
are the Arab racialists and the extreme orthodox that he talks about, however he
give us an example:
</p>

<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Taha Husain, the modernist Egyptian scholar, describes Ibn Khaldun as a man with an obnoxiously inflated ego and a dishonest rationalist who merely masqueraded as a Muslim.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>
So, Taha Husain The biggest enemy of Azhar and the fundamentalists in the 1990s, who
criticized political Islam in such a way that Muslims themselves doubted his faith.. is one
of the Arab racialists and the extreme orthodox. I've no comment on that.

<p>
You might notice that I didn't give a response to Hoodbhoy's claims about Avicenna and
al-Razi, and that's because: I couldn't find any relabel biography for al-Razi, I didn't
find also any reference that talked about Hoodbhoy's claim about his blindness, however I
found that one of the greatest fundamentalists in Islam, Imam Zahbi, Praises Abu Bakr
Al-Razi, which means he couldn't be a heretic.
</p>

<p>
And the reason for skipping Avicenna (Ibn Sina) is that he is the one that could be named a
'heretic', I'm not the one to talk about his, but the main point is that the mean reason
that made a lot of fundamentalists accuse him of infidelity is his issues with sufi
metaphysics (Arabic: وِحْدَّة الوُجودِ) it was not related to his science at all, even Ibn
Taymiyyah, the godfather of Sahwa, fundamentalists and even terrorists movements, absolved
him of infidelity after he had read in ibn Khallikān's biography about him that he "have
repent of all of his late heresy"<sup><a id="fnr.20" class="footref" href="#fn.20" role="doc-backlink">20</a></sup>, however Hoodbhoy prefers to believe that they just
didn't like that he was doing science and medicine, which is insanity.

<h3 id="orgf19257a">Underdevelopment</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf19257a">
<p>
I do have a problem with Hoodbhoy's presumed causes of underdevelopment in the Islamic
world, as I said before, the Islamic Its presentation was and is still vulnerable to
colonial and imperial movements and political upheavals, all of this affect the whole
educational process. As I said before, people of Syria won't probably think about doing
science while Israel bombs Damascus.

The attitude toward Islam is quite complex. The U.S. has always supported the most extreme
fundamentalist Islamic movements and still does. The oldest and most valued ally of the U.S.
in the Arab world is Saudi Arabia, which is also the most extremist fundamentalist state. By
comparison, Iran looks like a free democratic society – but Saudi Arabia was doing its job.
The enemy for most of this period has been secular nationalism. U.S.-Israeli relations, for
example, really firmed up in 1967 when Israel performed a real service for the U.S. and
Saudi Arabia.  Namely, it smashed the main center of secular nationalism, (Gamal Abdul)
Nasser’s Egypt, which was considered a threat and more or less at war with Saudi Arabia at
the time. It was threatening to use the huge resources of the region for the benefit of the
population of the countries of the region, and not to fill the pockets of some rich tyrant
while vast profits flowed to Western corporations.
