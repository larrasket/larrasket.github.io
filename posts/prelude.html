The following is an inverted part from a long note I've been working on recently
named "Notes on Mathematics", however not ready yet to be published (can't be
sure if it will ever be), but I felt the need to publish this part however.
</p>

<p>
It is not so common to have feelings towards one of the most, or actually the most, abstractive branch of science that ever existed, yet I'm always experiencing that collection of hunting and curiousness feelings whenever I contemplate a beautiful notation of mathematics, this has been occurring with me more frequently since the last month when I've seen the following equation which was posted originally by the <a href="https://twitter.com/infseriesbot/status/1635091916718247937">級数bot</a>:
</p>

<p>
Every time I look at it I imagine the elegance of equations, the harmony of
geometric shapes, for those with the eyes to see, mathematics reveals a glimpse
into the very fabric of the universe itself. It is the very essence of numbers
themselves that hold a certain allure. So let's consider that formula:
</p>

<p>
\[\frac{1}{1^3} - \frac{1}{3^3} + \frac{1}{5^3} - \frac{1}{7^3} + ... = \frac{\pi}{32}\]
</p>


<p>
I'd like first to talk about how does this work, the subtle interplay of
numbers that give rise to its elegance and precision. At its core, the formula
is a representation of the famous Basel problem, which seeks to find the sum of
the reciprocals of the squares of all positive integers. While this may seem
like a daunting task, the formula above provides a simple yet stunningly
effective solution.
</p>

<p>
By manipulating the alternating series of terms, we are able to transform it into a more manageable form, ultimately arriving at the value of \(\frac{\pi}{32}\) This is accomplished through a clever use of Fourier series and the Euler-Maclaurin formula, which allow us to approximate the sum of the infinite series with remarkable accuracy. This clear formula is more than just a functional tool; it is a symbol of the deep interconnectedness of all things. It is a reminder that even the most seemingly disparate concepts can be brought together in a meaningful way, and that through the pursuit of knowledge and truth, we can experience the profound mysteries of existence. For the great minds of humanity, the pursuit of truth, knowledge, and beauty were all interconnected aspects of the human experience. It was through the exploration of these concepts that we were able to connect with the transcendent nature of reality, and to transcend the limitations of our own individual perspectives.
</p>


<p>
I don't experience these feelings only in my personal reading and studies, but
I also notice this in some writings, especially from Bertrand Russell writings,
actually he says in his autobiography:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
There was a footpath leading across fields to New Southgate, and I used to go
there alone to watch the sunset and contemplate suicide. I did not, however,
commit suicide, because I wished to know more of mathematics.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
While people can imagine it's killing to spend your time doing proofs for things
that were given to you before, they just don't understand the joyfulness. And
notice that I didn't say "they can not feel it", because I don't really believe
it's possible, and I clearly do not believe that there are people who are
smarter than others so they don't experience these feelings, or as Descartes
puts it:
</p>


<blockquote>
<p>
Those who have this knowledge and awareness of themselves convince themselves
readily that all other human beings can have the same knowledge and awareness of
themselves: because there is nothing in all this that depends on anybody other
than oneself.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I'm yet not able to find a more precise description better than what Descartes
uses, which is knowledge. Though I can't abstract my feelings towards it at all,
since it's very mixed with nostalgia and appreciations. It's like a blocked
channel in a water flow, or even a minor who can't understand an adult
description of the joyfulness of sex.
</p>

<p>
La Géométrie is one of the most famous examples for that feelings (In which
Descartes is having a similar experience in doing some proofs that he delivered
to his students and us as incomplete.), if you have ever heard of this book,
it's known for being 'unclear', but actually this was very intended by him when
he said "I did not undertake to say everything, in order to give others the
pleasure of discovering [it] for themselves"<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup> . I've actually seen this as
recklessness, but I couldn't help imagining myself doing the same thing if I've
been through very pleasing journey. I really anticipate to be that the reason
why many mathematicians use the infamous "the proof is left to the reader as an
exercise", it's an invite to share the joyfulness.
</p>

<p>
It was not merely a tool for understanding the physical world, but rather a
means of exploring the deepest aspects of human consciousness and existence.
