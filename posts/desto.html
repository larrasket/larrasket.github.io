This is my re-reading of "The Insulted and Injured" as part of my
attempt to complete the complete work of Feydor Dostoyevsky. I had read
the novel for a very long time, when I began reading Dostoevsky, and at
that time I did not have the literary interest that makes me search
about this novel, and I get enough for saying: It is a good novel.
</p>

</div>


<p>
I definitely knew that studying such a novel would require preparation.
I did not begin it until I had finished with Henry Trouba's book
"Dostoevsky: His Life - His Works," which gives a good biography of
Dostoyevsky's life and the politics of the Russian Messenger Journal,
which apparently played a major role in his method, Which should have
been boring when it was detailed, but it was beautiful, expressive, full
of emotion and humanity.
</p>

<p>
I also benefited greatly from the study of Nicholas Trail, the literary
critic, of Raskolnikov's character from Dostoyevsky's novel Crime and
Punishment as well, Nicholas 'view that Dostoevsky's character with
epilepsy dominated his work, and whoever reads the crime and punishment
will not ask me for clarification of Nicholas' opinion, Raskolnikov is a
fickle hero Strange as it sounds, he has seizures in every event, but
Dostoevsky does not describe these seizures as epilepsy more than what
he describes as fever, fatigue and exhaustion, except that they always
come in the form of epileptic freaks.
</p>

<p>
As for this novel, it also applies to the concept of Nicholas, as the
hero not only has seizures (and by the way, this time the protagonist
himself has verbally confessed those seizures) but also lives the life
of Dostoevsky completely and suffers from the same problems, I must
mention here that Dostoevsky began This work (I mean the novel) with the
beginning of his serious work after his release from prison, he had
written before him the village of Stepanchikovo and its inhabitants, and
it was really one of his worst works, and by his own saying, it was a
vulgar comic whose only goal is to collect money after his release from
prison, as well as return to the world of writing.
</p>

<p>
Our novel carried a certain seriousness that made Dostoevsky himself a
hero in it. The problem of the protagonist is very similar to the
problem of Raskolnikov, as well as the problem of "Basement Man", a
poor, proud writer looking for a way out to get rid of his misery and
misery, and in fact I see that Dostoevsky in this novel was influenced
by the Victorians most influenced Especially the later ones: the
coincidences he put in the novel only occur in a Victorian / classic
novel, such as Oliver Dickens or Hugo's Hunchback, and this is what made
Russian critics (who were very real at the time) describe the novel as
"extremely fictional."
</p>

<p>
As I mentioned at the beginning, the policy of Russian magazines,
especially the magazine "The Russian Messenger" and "Time" magazine has
greatly influenced Dostoevsky's writings. The novel is long and not in
excess. Dostoyevsky takes whole pages in some descriptions that could
have been reduced to one or two words, In some absolutely insignificant
dialogues he takes an entire chapter, yet (and this is what
distinguishes Dostoyevsky from Tolstoy in lengthening) Dostoevsky's
lengthening was a little more than a filler.
</p>

<p>
Dostoevsky's epileptic personality is reflected in the main characters:
Ilyosha, Ivan, and Helen, and the three are psychologically misfits due
to their occasional seizures, and the main character, Ivan, features
Dostoyevsky's defiant character at the time. Vissarion Belinsky, a great
Russian critic at the time, after Fedor wrote his first book "The Poor,"
which was the most beautiful opening by a writer at the time, his
subsequent writing came like a dream of Uncle and others until his
imprisonment, and no one expected him to produce something of value,
especially Belinsky.
