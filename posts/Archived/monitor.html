Isn't a shame that this place of the internet is supposed to be a blog yet doesn't contain
blogs but obscure philosophies?
</p>

<p>
Reallocated in my family home again, a colleague told me that he knows somebody that is able
to provide me a nice frameless-touchscreen 23.80 inches monitor for a very low price,
comparable to the average prices here due to customs, it's pretty low; so he just exports it
for personal use and sell it for profit. Fair enough, I said. So I went there, tested the
monitor, everything looks great.
</p>

<p>
I already have a secondary as mentioned, it's plugged through the only HDMI port into my
laptop, "Where will I plug the new one?" I asked, "Hmmm I don't know, but since it's just
about data transfer through an external port like USB-C or something" my internal voice
responded.  (No need to mention that I didn't know that I can use dock and solve this whole
issue, I'm a relatively uncivilized third-world human and I never knew such a thing
existed), I was left was the following thoughts;
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>HDMI Splitter (Suggested by the seller)</li>
<li>USB-C Adapter</li>
<li>USB-A Adapter</li>
</ul>


<div id="outline-container-org614e0bd" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org614e0bd">First Try; HDMI Splitter</h2>

Worked fine but there is one main issue, it doesn't plug a second monitor to your machine
the but it plugs a new monitor to the monitor plugged in your machine. I.e. it will send the
signal for both of them, just like an old fashion DSL splitter.
</p>

Like my head voice suggested the first thing that came out to my mind is using Type-C USB
converter, it's pretty fast and Apple already did that before with Mac books, and the
monitor is modern enough to be compatible with this setup. I ordered "USB31_C_HDMI_ADP",
three days later it was delivered. Never worked, not even given a single sign that it's
going to work, after some investigation found out that my machine USB-C specification said
"that's simply not possible".
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Connect to an external storage, or data devices.  Note: An appropriate adapter may be needed
for connecting external devices. This connector cannot be used to connect external display
devices
</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga2f6a94" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga2f6a94">Third Try; USB-A</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga2f6a94">
<p>
After while I learned that using DisplayLink is possible, yet I couldn't find a way to
purchase a one without paying +$100 for customs. So I had to use a USB-A converter that uses
the manufacturers' firmware (which implies, of course, my machine have to be compatible with
those firmware). Again, I purchased a USB-A converter "MACROSILICON Display Adapter".
</p>


<p>
After I plugged it into my machine, reading <code>dmesg</code> I noticed that it's being linked to
<code>/sys/bus/usb/drivers/snd-usb-audio/</code>, which means that it's being treated as a USB audio
device. So I had to force it to <code>unbind</code> this, using this <code>udevadm</code> role:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="org51d7d94">
# For HDMI-to-USB adaptor:
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", DRIVER=="snd-usb-audio", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2109", ATTRS{idVendor}=="534d", \
    RUN+="/bin/sh -c 'echo -n $kernel &gt; /sys/bus/usb/drivers/snd-usb-audio/unbind'"
</pre>

<p>
After this amount of work I found out that this piece should be used for USB video device
class like webcams, digital camcorders, transcoders, analog video converters and still-image
cameras, etc..
</p>

<p>
So, getting this to work was in vain.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org6a17b14" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6a17b14">Fourth Try; USB-A (Right Piece)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6a17b14">
<p>
I found an abscure company called Fresco Logic that develops this kind of solution with
claimed Linux/Android driver support, and that's the other story.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org0ade6e3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org0ade6e3">Linux Driver</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0ade6e3">
<p>
It sounds like the so-called driver that fresco logic developed was disconnected since 2021,
I use the latest 6.1.7 kernel which means this will never compile, note that you have to
build it yourself since it uses your linux-headers toolchain to build, so at least you need
to use a build that matches your current kernel, otherwise you will get invalid object
message.
</p>

<p>
Another is story is me trying to downgrade the Kernel to 5.6 to get this to work, but we
shall not proceed into this for now, a plot-twist is even after swapping to 5.6 it didn't
compile. "So why not go through the code, update the APIs and get it to work for you?", I'd
have you to look at the code first my dear;
</p>

</figure>

<p>
Anyway, I tried 5.7, 5.5, 5.8, 5.15, and eventually 5.10 worked (no idea of how). So now it
compiled, how to use it? Plot-twist 2: it is not a driver, it's a prototype proof of
concept that this piece can be used in linux, but no DRM available.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile.. Windows A ubiquitous advantage for Windows that is commonly mentioned in these
situations that it 'just works'. So I installed Windows to give it a try, sadly it was right.

<p>
The DRM I coded was very insecure unfortunately and I couldn't risk depending on it, when I
was completely desperate an idea came to my mind reminding me that I had an old unused
laptop with Windows installed, I could use it connected to the monitor and connect it with
barrier to my main laptop, so it feels like it is just another monitor (with restricted
filesystem access lol). Unexpectedly it worked:

<p>
This experience raised some questions to my head about the reliability of LKMs, the Windows
driver efficiently works in like all Windows versions (each has many different build
versions), and due to kernel APIs change in linux-headers it can not work after any related
kernel patches, could that be the reason that the NVIDIA drivers have too frequent updates
in Linux compared to Windows? To make sure it will work? I don't know I'm not a kernel
engineer, but really this experience could be much pleasant than that easily.
