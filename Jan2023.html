I'm pretty paranoid (as mostly claimed) of coding. I always think of the art of programming
in its all ways (OO, XP, etc..); it had to be done right. Maybe the reason of that was that
I've seen a good deal of computers abusement. In my first job I've seen some code like:
</p>
<pre class="example" id="orgc76ad86">
class slider {
  ...
}
</pre>
<p>
And the so-called 'developer' needed another slider in the UI, what do you think? Another
object of the same type?
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgba25554">
class otherslider {
  ...
}
</pre>

<p>
Yes. Anyways; always write programs like if it will count for you in the doomsday. I created
this entity to talk about a different thing; that is me being equally paranoid about music.
Or even much more. The reason that nobody probably noticed that is that I ennoble it
that I would never approach it. What upsets me about that is that I feel the same caprice of
indignation seeing someone writes ugly code, when I notice somebody underestimating the
greatness of a symphony or a chant. People, music is one of the greatest gifts of humanity,
it is not something to 'fill' your time<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> with, it's something to embrace, contemplate
and deep dive into it. Having a type of music that is 'shareable' is very unusual thing;
it's like having four hundred friends; a friend of everybody is a friend to none. Have a
look into the aesthetic philosophy of your music, lookup your enthusiasm there, and enjoy
they journey of isolated autism with music.

<i>obviously, if you prefer to listen to hiphop, rap, underground or any other خرا mainstream;
you have much bigger problem to work on</i>.

I love the ability of teleportation with our future-selves (maybe a one-way teleportation
would be more precise); I used to do this since an early age when I was thinking If I'd be
able to reach the light switch the next age, actually I remember when I did and I recall
when I remembered that I would remember; time goes these timeline-challenges changed; I was
wondering if some day I'd be able to read faster, talk in a different language, if I would
memorize the whole Quran sooner; being able to solve math and logic problem more easily;
even at the more recency, in school, I was thinking if I will solve problems faster: I had a
list of codeforces problems that I collected when I was at my first-year, the hardest of
them didn't take more than 3 minutes to comprehend it which would take &gt; 40 for the old me.
No new year resolution; but I'd leave some messages to the future me that I wonder if you
will satisfy my expectation for the coming age.
