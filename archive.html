René Descartes contributes to a long tradition of philosophical inquiry into the
nature of "the passions", I find inspiration in many of Descartes writings,
however I hesitate to share them because I don't find reading them separately
will add actually any value; however I fonund this work "Les Passions de l'âme"
has many useful independent points. Following is an anthology for this great
work. (Arabic translations are provided!)

A life principle that I always try to live by is: "reasons not feelings", humans
are not cleaver in accepting that naturally, that nature needs taming to accept

I have mentioned before my perspectives on the social media dilemma <a href="conditioning.html">here</a> (I don't recommend
reading it if you did not, I wrote it fanatically 3 years ago), my clue was correlated to the

something like upvotes or likes on the internet, and how we're being conditioned to it just

The following poem by Fredrick Nietzsche, from Thus, Spoke Zarathustra made me sense some very
melodious feelings; that one that teleportation yields sometimes which, by the way, an
ingrained humanistic thing; it gentles us the feel of an affable existence. This is an
adapted Arabic translation (I feel more poetic in Arabic). <i>Followed by the English version</i>.

It was a thunderbolt reading Nietzsche's collected poems for the first time, felt like
discovering a revelation of his, also over the time and over grasping Nietzsche's
'philosophy' more and more, it turns to make any verselet standing along with, let's say, a
piece from Ecce Homo, as a very atypical thing.

Perhaps Daingerfield couldn't show the same 'proclamation of opprobrium' for those who will
never sense the toils nor the summits, as Byron did. However, I could discern every iota of

There is a common ground between the meaning of a 'declaimist' and a
non-intellectual that you see on daily basis especially in average
social media site, I don't want to single out a live example but let's
take \(x\) and \(let\) \(x\) be right-wing social media intellectual who
has more than 100k loyal follower of his medieval instructions about
miscarriage or the sexual orientations, if one day \(x\) figured out, or
even less revolutionary, let's say he'd found that some of his beliefs
are either wrong or obsolete, what would he do? I can tell the answer is
cognitive dissonance tends to be ended by denial of facts, trying to
stick to what he already believes (just like Chatelier's principle
object), he is not only required to comprehend whatever he believes in,
but his loyal fellows also are waiting for his directive, he won't let
them down. It's getting worse in cases in which x has already a lot of
bestselling publications which in he insures his points. Of course,
within time numerous intellectuals are getting a cognitive flexibility
enables them to change their thoughts smoothly, however, the majority
won't.

Several enthusiastic historical practitioners of chess have espoused their beliefs that the
skills associated with chess can be extrapolated to external scenarios. One of the first
documented cases of an intellectual asserting that connections exist between chess
proficiency and other skills is Benjamin Franklin’s 1750 essay The Morales of Chess. In this
essay, Franklin hypothesized that “The game of Chess is not merely an idle amusement.
Several very valuable qualities of the mind, useful in the course of human life, are to be
acquired or strengthened by it, so as to become habits, ready on all occasions.” He then
enumerated these specific qualities, listing them as “1. Foresight… 2. Circumspection… 3.
Caution… [and] lastly… the habit of not being discouraged by present bad appearances in the
state of our affairs.”

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org27f6d80">
<p>
The role of the media in contemporary politics forces us to ask what
kind of a world and what kind of a society we want to live in, and in
particular in what sense of democracy do we want this to be a democratic
society? Let me begin by counter-posing two different conceptions of
democracy. One conception of democracy has it that a democratic society
is one in which the public has the means to participate in some
meaningful way in the management of their own affairs and the means of
information are open and free. If you look up democracy in the
dictionary you'll get a definition something like that.
