I don&rsquo;t usually post many stuff about myself online, I will try to set this page
as a way of making up for this. I don&rsquo;t like the aspect in general to have a
virtual life, this was why I didn&rsquo;t care much to post details about me online.
However, this tended to make people presume things about. I hope that this page
will help reducing the severity of unsupported thoughts about me.

<p>
I&rsquo;m not currently certain about listing my profession, despite it being self-explanatory
from many posts here and my general online activity, however, I do not like to be defined
by it at all, and any other professions in which I may get involved forthcoming.
</p>

<p>
This to imply to you my view of what is &rsquo;professional&rsquo;, if I ever had the opportunity of
being financially independent I&rsquo;d definitely be. I&rsquo;m not the kind of &ldquo;I love my job&rdquo;
people<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
I might have to say that I also dislike this kind of lifestyle.
</span>, however, I do love my job, but it&rsquo;s a love that means to an end: not to
starve to death<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
I&rsquo;ve always thought about how obvious this should be, unfortunately my field is one
of the most domains that get people who are &ldquo;in love&rdquo; with their job or what they&rsquo;re
doing, that&rsquo;s why I thought I needed to put this clear.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
This is also to say that I don&rsquo;t like spending my time out of work doing, thinking,
reading, discussing, or —God forbid— studying anything that is related to my profession.
I&rsquo;ve many other <a href="#orgc7deb8a">Interests</a> to spend my time on rather than whatever I do to make money.

I do not use Spotify or any other music proprietary platforms. I download and stream music
offline on my computer machine. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmus">cmus</a> is my music player. See <a href="#org91a7881">Planned</a> for my plans for
building a music player.

Currently, I&rsquo;m not interested in exploring any new types of music, I prefer to stick to
the collection I already have.

There’s truth that lives <br>

<p>
My first time of experiencing Cohen&rsquo;s music was from opening one of my colleagues Spotify
accounts, I was in high school back then, when I listened to the music, which was Sing
Another Song, Boys, the seventh song from Songs Of Love And Hate (my ever favorite album
of his by now), I didn&rsquo;t like it initially, but I felt that it was very different from
anything I&rsquo;ve ever listened to (and I still believe that it&rsquo;s indeed a unique work of
music).
</p>

<p>
I remember that I spent days listening to it, I was back then possessing some interest in
pursuing a biotechnology degree and I was studying a biochemistry textbook; I still get
some intrusive chemical formulas into my head every time I play the song, because I used
to study that book while listening to it on repeat, though I do not mind it at all.
</p>

<p>
I didn&rsquo;t play any other songs by him since that, so I can say that the real time
for me to learn about Cohen was from the movie <a href="https://youtu.be/TXwCCWHl5Ak">Exotica (1994)</a>, since then I fell
in love with his songwritings, following are my favorite works from him (not sorted):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Songs Of Love And Hate - 7. Sing Another Song, Boys</li>
<li>Leonard Cohen - Thanks for the Dance - 6. The Goal</li>
<li>Thanks for the Dance - 1. Happens to the Heart</li>
<li>You Want It Darker - 7. It Seemed the Better Way</li>
<li>Cohen Live - 9. Who By Fire? - Live in Austin, 1988</li>
<li>Live In Dublin - 8. Amen - Live in Dublin</li>
<li>Various Positions - 6. The Captain</li>
<li>Death Of A Ladies&rsquo; Man - 1. True Love Leaves No Traces</li>
<li>Songs Of Leonard Cohen - 9. Teachers</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m Your Man - 3. Everybody Knows</li>
<li>Ten New Songs - 4. Here It Is</li>
<li>Recent Songs - 2. Humbled in Love</li>

This piece is a one of my very few specials. I remember learning about it for the first time
from the movie V for Vendetta (2005), which is one of my ever favorites, but I didn&rsquo;t pay
much attention back then, and I think I only learnt about it by the 2022 Russian invasion
of Ukraine. It affects me very much, and it gives me vibes from <a href="https://youtu.be/p3pfJukO5QU">Shadows of Forgotten

<h2 id="orgc7deb8a">Interests</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc7deb8a">
<p>
I&rsquo;m interested in the following fields: computer programming, cognitive science,
linguistics, history, scientific socialism, propaganda and media studies, moral
philosophy and <del>philosophy of mind</del>, Islamic philosophy, Islamic biographical
evaluation and modern Takhrij studies. I&rsquo;ve developed a growing interest in the
following fields: chemistry and economics.
</p>

<p>
Other interests are implied in my <a href="../fullbooks.html#omy9ejo02wj0">Books</a> list.
</p>

<p>
I consider myself to be an intermediate chess player, my peak rating (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glicko_rating_system">Glicko</a>) was 1950, my
current rating on my only active account is 1808 (after a long strike of losing). For my
thoughts on chess, see the post <a href="../d/chess2.html#b8u34341owj0">Thoughts on Chess</a>.
</p>

<p>
Generally I think chess is one of the few games that I&rsquo;d like to play (I think gaming is a
great waste of time in general), the game GO seems interesting too.
</p>

<p>
What I like about this kind of games that it is free of anything but the free will of
one&rsquo;s decisions. See more on that on <a href="../d/chess2.html#mp56qej0fzj0">A View on Chess</a>.

<p>
Olive is my favorite food, most of my favorite recipes contain olive. There is no
-generally speaking- any kind of food that I would refuse to eat, however I do
refuse to consume any food that contains any form of artificial sweeteners (raw
sugar, refined white sugar, etc..).
</p>

<p>
My favorite drink is tea. I do consume lemonade regularly too. My consumption of
coffee is high as well, however I do not really prefer it and I only drink it
for my need of caffeine. If I can find someday a caffeine substitute (that is
comparable to ground coffee) I will quit coffee. I drink only ground coffee. I
try to avoid manufactured instant coffee for health concerns (also most instance
coffee products do not have approximate amount of caffeine that ground coffee
posses).

musql. I&rsquo;d love a queryable music player that would support generating sets of
music using a complex tagging system. Let&rsquo;s say that you have a playlist for
sad songs and another one for you when you feel proud. What if you feel both?
like a success depression. A possible solution would be creating a new list
that includes both. However, what if you need a list that contains only the
sad songs that are not about love? It will be impossible with that linear
system to do it without manual intervention.
</p>

<p>
But if you were able to tag each song as &ldquo;sad, love&rdquo;, and you had a DSL
language for querying (let it be even just SQL), such scenario is very
feasible.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this idea for a fairly long time. But I&rsquo;m horrible at
designing/implementing UI ends. If you can help, contact me.
</p></li>

<li>(as of <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2024-10-17 Thu 18:15]</span></span>, I&rsquo;m no longer interested in this)  <a href="https://sr.ht/~lr0/cblocks/">cblocks</a>. I started
this project as an exercise for my C fluency and because I needed an alternative for the
dwm bar I&rsquo;m using, with more flexibility. This project was successful (it reads a
compiled C module, load, evaluate it and update the status bar with the evaluated
string), however, I wanted to add concurrency which is an essential feature for me.
Sadly I totally forgot how hard was it to work with concurrency in C. I think I might
rewrite it in Go, but I&rsquo;m not sure who to implement the dynamism in Go.</li>

I like to read and study animal behavior. We humans have many intersection

behavior.  Desmond Morris was the first one to get me interested in reading
about animal behavior, after I finished his magnum opus (the naked ape) I was
