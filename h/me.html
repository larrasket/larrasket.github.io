<p>I don't usually post many stuff about myself online, I will try to
set this page as a way of making up for this. I don't like the aspect in
general to have a virtual life, this was why I didn't care much to post
details about me online. However, this tended to make people presume
things about. I hope that this page will help reducing the severity of
unsupported thoughts about me.</p>
<h1 id="occupation">Occupation</h1>
<p>I'm not currently certain about listing my profession, despite it
being self-explanatory from many posts here and my general online
activity, however, I do not like to be defined by it at all, and any
other professions in which I may get involved forthcoming.</p>
<p>This to imply to you my view of what is 'professional', if I ever had
the opportunity of being financially independent I'd definitely be. I'm
not the kind of "I love my job" people<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>,
however, I do love my job, but it's a love that means to an end: not to

21:57] I acknowledge that I got the opportunity to work with a set of a
very smart people that I enjoy being surrounded by and having them as a
company. I might need to write about this era of my life someday)</p>
<p>This is also to say that I don't like spending my time out of work
doing, thinking, reading, discussing, or —God forbid— studying anything
that is related to my profession. I've many other <a

that my top music artists are:</p>

For me, this is the most peaceful piece of music I've ever heard.</p>
<p>I do not use Spotify or any other music proprietary platforms. I
download and stream music offline on my computer machine. <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmus">cmus</a> is my music player.
See <a href="#Planned">7.1</a> for my plans for building a music
player.</p>
<p>Currently, I'm not interested in exploring any new types of music, I
prefer to stick to the collection I already have.</p>
<h2 id="leonard-cohen">Leonard Cohen</h2>
<blockquote>
There’s truth that lives<br />
And truth that dies<br />
I don’t know which<br />
So nevermind<br />

</blockquote>
<p>My first time of experiencing Cohen's music was from opening one of
my colleagues Spotify accounts, I was in high school back then, when I
listened to the music, which was Sing Another Song, Boys, the seventh
song from Songs Of Love And Hate (my ever favorite album of his by now),
I didn't like it initially, but I felt that it was very different from
anything I've ever listened to (and I still believe that it's indeed a
unique work of music).</p>
<p>I remember that I spent days listening to it, I was back then
possessing some interest in pursuing a biotechnology degree and I was
studying a biochemistry textbook; I still get some intrusive chemical
formulas into my head every time I play the song, because I used to
study that book while listening to it on repeat, though I do not mind it
at all.</p>
<p>I didn't play any other songs by him since that, so I can say that
the real time for me to learn about Cohen was from the movie <a
href="https://youtu.be/TXwCCWHl5Ak">Exotica (1994)</a>, since then I
fell in love with his songwritings, following are my favorite works from
him (not sorted):</p>
<ul>
<li>Songs Of Love And Hate - 7. Sing Another Song, Boys</li>
<li>Leonard Cohen - Thanks for the Dance - 6. The Goal</li>
<li>Thanks for the Dance - 1. Happens to the Heart</li>
<li>You Want It Darker - 7. It Seemed the Better Way</li>
<li>Cohen Live - 9. Who By Fire? - Live in Austin, 1988</li>
<li>Live In Dublin - 8. Amen - Live in Dublin</li>
<li>Various Positions - 6. The Captain</li>
<li>Death Of A Ladies' Man - 1. True Love Leaves No Traces</li>
<li>Songs Of Leonard Cohen - 9. Teachers</li>
<li>I'm Your Man - 3. Everybody Knows</li>
<li>Ten New Songs - 4. Here It Is</li>
<li>Recent Songs - 2. Humbled in Love</li>
<li>Recent Songs - 10. Ballad of the Absent Mare - Longer Version</li>
<li>Songs Of Love And Hate - 1. Avalanche</li>

<h2 id="nostalgical-music">Nostalgical Music</h2>
<p>I'm easily stirred by music that brings nostalgic melody. I don't
dislike it, but it extremely affects my mood<a href="#fn3"

Thus I tend to avoid having or listening to any of this genre. Some
songs that gives me this kind of vibes are:<a href="#fn4"

<h2 id="piotr-ilich-tchaikovskys-1812-overture-finale.">Piotr Ilich
Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture Finale".</h2>
<p>This piece is a one of my very few specials. I remember learning
about it for the first time from the movie V for Vendetta (2005), which
is one of my ever favorites, but I didn't pay much attention back then,
and I think I only learnt about it by the 2022 Russian invasion of
Ukraine. It affects me very much, and it gives me vibes from <a
href="https://youtu.be/p3pfJukO5QU">Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors
(Sergei Parajanov, 1965)</a>. I only listen to / play both in special
occasions, due to their great effect on me.</p>
<h1 id="interests">Interests</h1>
<p>I'm interested in the following fields: computer programming,
cognitive science, linguistics, history, scientific socialism,
propaganda and media studies, moral philosophy and <del>philosophy of
mind</del>, Islamic philosophy, Islamic biographical evaluation and
modern Takhrij studies. I've developed a growing interest in the
following fields: chemistry and economics.</p>
<p>Other interests are implied in my <a href="id:omy9ejo02wj0">Books</a>
list.</p>
<p>I consider myself to be an intermediate chess player, my peak rating
(<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glicko_rating_system">Glicko</a>)
was 1950, my current rating on my only active account is 1808 (after a
long strike of losing). For my thoughts on chess, see the post <a
href="id:b8u34341owj0">Thoughts on Chess</a>.</p>
<p>Generally I think chess is one of the few games that I'd like to play
(I think gaming is a great waste of time in general), the game GO seems
interesting too.</p>
<p>What I like about this kind of games that it is free of anything but
the free will of one's decisions. See more on that on <a
href="id:mp56qej0fzj0">A View on Chess</a>.</p>
<h1 id="personal-preferences">Personal preferences</h1>
<p>Olive is my favorite food, most of my favorite recipes contain olive.
There is no -generally speaking- any kind of food that I would refuse to
eat, however I do refuse to consume any food that contains any form of
artificial sweeteners (raw sugar, refined white sugar, etc..).</p>
<p>My favorite drink is tea. I do consume lemonade regularly too. My
consumption of coffee is high as well, however I do not really prefer it
and I only drink it for my need of caffeine. If I can find someday a
caffeine substitute (that is comparable to ground coffee) I will quit
coffee. I drink only ground coffee. I try to avoid manufactured instant
coffee for health concerns (also most instance coffee products do not
have approximate amount of caffeine that ground coffee posses).</p>
<h1 id="on-the-web">On the web</h1>
<p>I exist in other places on the web. I'm on Stack Exchange network.
Especially: <a
href="https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/users/69248/">Skeptics SE</a>
and <a href="https://islam.stackexchange.com/users/56455/">Islam SE</a>.
I also exist on <a
href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=lr0">HN</a>. I don't use
social media to connect with people. Even when I do, I do not appreciate
people who I don't know in person communicating with me there.</p>
<h2 id="if-you-want-to-know-me">If you want to know me</h2>
<p>This gets me to another point. Some people think I'm avoidant for new
people. I'm not at all, if you find that we share interests, I'd be glad
to know more about you. The best way to communicate with me can be found
on the footer of the home page.</p>

<p>Projects that I'm considering to get into next.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><del>musql</del>. I'd love a queryable music player that would
support generating sets of music using a complex tagging system. Let's
say that you have a playlist for sad songs and another one for you when
you feel proud. What if you feel both? like a success depression. A
possible solution would be creating a new list that includes both.
However, what if you need a list that contains only the sad songs that
are not about love? It will be impossible with that linear system to do
it without manual intervention.</p>
<p>But if you were able to tag each song as "sad, love", and you had a
DSL language for querying (let it be even just SQL), such scenario is
very feasible.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about this idea for a fairly long time. But I'm
horrible at designing/implementing UI ends. If you can help, contact
me.</p>

<a href="https://sr.ht/~lr0/cblocks/">cblocks</a>. I started this
project as an exercise for my C fluency and because I needed an
alternative for the dwm bar I'm using, with more flexibility. This
project was successful (it reads a compiled C module, load, evaluate it
and update the status bar with the evaluated string), however, I wanted
to add concurrency which is an essential feature for me. Sadly I totally
forgot how hard was it to work with concurrency in C. I think I might
rewrite it in Go, but I'm not sure who to implement the dynamism in
Go.</p></li>
