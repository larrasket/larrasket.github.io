I&rsquo;ve recently received an interesting assessment for developing a system &ldquo;a
small part of an ERP system with a  focus on the purchasing process&rdquo;. However,
the interesting part that I found was in the long list of implementation
requirements I found in that assessment, which I find pretty handful for
engineers to test their understanding (as well as for HMs of course) of topics
like CQRS, Publish-Subscribe Systems, DDD, Onion Architecture and many other
interesting topics. The assignment PDF is available for download <a href="../i/dsa.pdf">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
I will document in this post my progress with the development and the
requirements.
</p>

<p>
I will start with the first 3 requirements:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Apply the solution for the above problem statement using DDD considering the
different  bounded contexts different</li>
<li>Each context should be in a separate repo, and each repo should have a single
branch  only for all work even for incomplete work, without that single
branch getting damaged,  or impacted by the incomplete work</li>
<li>Each context should be a standalone process</li>
</ol>

</blockquote></div>
<div id="outline-container-orgffd1006" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgffd1006">Domain-Driven Design (req. #1, #2, and #3)</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgffd1006">
<p>
Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is one of the most common paradigms in dealing with
systems of big scale, and pretty common in large scale systems. Of course what
we are dealing with here is not a large scale system, the business rules are
pretty straightforward and could be modeled into a simple monolithic app and
scaled easily, however, for the sake of the test we can neglect this fact.
</p>

<p>
One of the most used architectural designs in this case is Onion
Architecture<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
A lot of time I see the misusing of &ldquo;Clean Architecture&rdquo; to describe Onion
Architecture. The former was just how Robert C. Martin described Onion
Architecture: a clean one. But it is not its name.
</span>.
