A rebuttal to Joel Yliluoma&rsquo;s claims on &ldquo;The Islamic claim to Jerusalem&rdquo;
</p>

</div>

<p>
The claim that I&rsquo;d like to discuss in this article is, as stated by Joel
Yliluoma (internet name: bisqwit):
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Muslims covet Jerusalem is because it is something that belongs to the jews.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
(his post can be found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230628160115/https://bisqwit.iki.fi/story/apologetics/alaqsa/">here</a>)
</p>

<p>
This is supposed to be a little bit of non-political comment to me and more
centered about Tafsir and ʿaqīdah, however I can not help noticing that this
actually follows one of the common patterns that I&rsquo;ve seen from Zionist
propaganda, which tries a lot to reduce the whole war/conflict/occupation to
&ldquo;Muslim terrorists attacking peaceful only democracy one the middle east Israel&rdquo;,
shipped with all the propaganda and Islamophobia that the west propagates these
days, it has a noticeable effect on manufacturing the contest of the population.
Actually Yliluoma uses even in this post one of these claims that the US-Israeli
lobby promoted after the war on Gaza 2021 in the New York Times, right after the
same newspaper published an article on the kids, schools that the Israeli did
bombard (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahr_El-Baqar_primary_school_bombing">nothing new for the Israeli to attack schools</a>, civilians, hospitals and
unarmed institution, they did the same thing in their), which was an ad that
claimed that all what the Palestine Resistance has nothing to do with that
Israel does, but the fact that they antisemitic Muslim terrorists who don&rsquo;t like
jew and wish them dead.

</figure>

<p>
You see, Israelis make a very naive but useful argument by promoting such
claims, that this war has nothing to do with rights, it is just Muslims, which
is similarly how Yliluoma makes it an &ldquo;Islamic&rdquo; claim of Jerusalem. Not only you
disinform people and manipulate their judgment, but also you get everyone who
has anything against Islam on your side.
</p>

<p>
However I was a little surprised by such a statement comes from an intellectual
person like Yliluoma, because it basically dismiss everything about the history
of this land and presume that it always has been like that, &ldquo;Israel&rdquo;. Nothing
happened in the 1900s, antisemitic was not a thing in Europa that made many jews
migrate, Winston Churchill didn&rsquo;t help the expansion of the jews migrations, and
of course the US didn&rsquo;t capitalize Israel over all of this years. It is just
Israel has been there and Muslims trying to demolish it because their false
beliefs. You need either to be very brainwashed by Zionist propaganda to believe
such delusions or to have an interest in some AIPAC funding.
</p>



<p>
I&rsquo;m not aware a lot of Yliluoma&rsquo;s interests, however as far as I know he has
lots against Islam, and lots of zeal to Israel.

I will try to talk less politics from here and we shall delve into his claims.

<div id="outline-container-org80454cd" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org80454cd">Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org80454cd">
<p>
Yliluoma states:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
First of all, the Aya 17:1 makes no mention of Jerusalem. It just mentions a
“distant Mosque”. Historically speaking, when this verse was given, there were
no Islamic buildings in the lands of Israel. You read المسجد الاقصى‎ (al-Masjid
al-Aqsa), and you immediately interpret it as al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem,
because that is the name of a place you know, and that is how you have been
taught to interpret it in this 22th century culture. The name was given to the
Mosque that was built there by Umar, of the Rashidun caliphate, which came into
existence after the death of Muhammad. In other words, it did not exist in the
time of the supposed life of Muhammad. But you have to read the text in its
historic context. You cannot put effect before cause. The name for a place (and
the place itself) came long after the text. What did the words mean when the
text was written?
</p>

</blockquote></div>


<p>
This argument is based on a misunderstanding of the word &ldquo;mosque&rdquo; in Arabic,
which is an adverbial of place (i.e. <a href="https://youtu.be/a9Sl6gfKMIQ">Ism al-Makan</a>) an Ism Makan is any place to which
that the stem verb of the word is applicable, for example the word &ldquo;لعب&rdquo; (La&rsquo;ib), means
play, if we add a &ldquo;م&rdquo; (Mim&ldquo;) to get &rdquo;مَلعب&ldquo; (Mal&rsquo;ab) we gen a place adverbial
means &rdquo;the place where people can play&ldquo;, so a mosque in Arabic, Masjid, means the
place where people can practice the stem
&rdquo;Sujūd."<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Mamdouh N. Mohammad, “Overview of Salat,” in <i>Salat: The Islamic Prayer from a to Z</i> (Dr. Mahmdouh N. Mohammad, 2003), 6–7.</span> So basically what the Quran meant here
is that there is a place that the prophet/people preformed a type of prayer
there.
</p>

<p>
Another example of this naming is Masjid al-Haram (Mosque of Mecca, of Kabaa),
people think of the stereotype of a Masjid when they hear the name but Masjid
al-Haram was there even before the prophet, according to the Islamic beliefs the
Haram mosque was built ages before the prophecy of
Muhammad,<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">John Esposito, <i>Islam: The Straight Path</i>, 3rd ed. (Oxford University Press, 1998).</span> some Islamic scholars like Ibn al-Jawzi
claims that it was even built by Adam (see his &ldquo;Kitab Kashf al-Mushkil min
Hadith al-Sahihayn, No. 360&rdquo;).
</p>

<p>
Now Yliluoma is correct about that the name Aqsa means the distant, how we can
tell that it is the same mosque in Palestine?
</p>

<p>
Well no ones actually questioned this because it was always very obvious. First
of all it&rsquo;s knonw that Muslims used to preform Sujod with Qibla to Masjid Bayt
al-Maqdis (the Masjid of Jerusalem) before the prayer direction (Qiblah) was
changed to be in the face of Al-Masjid- al-Haram (at Makkah) [Quran 1:144].
Companion Al-Bara&rsquo; ibn Azib reported explicitly (<a href="https://sunnah.com/nasai:488">Sunan an-Nasa&rsquo;i No. 488</a>):
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
&ldquo;We prayed toward Bait Al-Maqdis [Masjid of Jerusalem] with the Messenger of Allah for
sixteen or seventeen months - Safwan was not sure - then it was changed to the
Qiblah [Makkah].&rdquo;
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
The prophet himself explicitly stated that the Mosque was in Jerusalem (<a href="https://sunnah.com/muslim:162a">Sahih
Muslim No. 316</a>):
</p>
<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
I mounted it and came to the Temple <b>(Bait Maqdis in Jerusalem)</b><label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
In despite of Sunnah.com&rsquo;s parentheses, this is included in the original Arabic text (قَالَ فَرَكِبْتُهُ حَتَّى أَتَيْتُ بَيْتَ الْمَقْدِسِ).
</span> , then
tethered it to the ring used by the prophets.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
Yliluoma states:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
English translations of Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim and some translations
of Qur’an add the subtitle “(in Jerusalem)” where al-Aqsa is mentioned, but
these subtitles are modern-day additions by modern-day Muslims, added to impose
a particular interpretation on the reader. No such reference exists in the
original Arabic text.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
This is basically invalid.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org41144b1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org41144b1">The Jerusalem Theory</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org41144b1">
<p>
Yliluoma states:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Then the Surah goes on to talk about Moses (Musa) and Noah (Nuh), and speaks
about the Torah and how God made it a guidance (17:2). Now we get context! A
concept, that is indeed confirmed numerous times in Qur’an. Again, something
that I can agree with. Tawrat and Injeel are guidance, and they were valid at
the time of Muhammad, and the Qur’an esteems them, even to the extent of saying
“if you have any questions about [God’s] revelation, go ask the Jews and
Christians, because they have read the Torah and Gospels long before you”
(3:3–4, 5:43–48, 5:68, 10:94, et al.) There would be no point for God to say
something like that, if the Jews and Christians did not have the right text.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
I&rsquo;d like to comment first on this citation:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
“if you have any questions about [God’s] revelation, go ask the Jews and
Christians, because they have read the Torah and Gospels long before you”
(3:3–4, 5:43–48, 5:68, 10:94, et al.)
</p>

</blockquote></div>
<p>
While this is a very bad way to cite anything, it&rsquo;s an extremely bad method to
cite a religious text especially one that its interpretations/translations are
very subjective. I will go through the verses that Yliluoma included:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
<a href="https://quran.com/3?startingVerse=3">Quran 3:3-4</a>:
</p>
<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
He has revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ the Book in truth, confirming what came
before it, as He revealed the Torah and the Gospel [.] previously, as a guide
for people, and ˹also˺ revealed the Standard ˹to distinguish between right and
wrong˺.1 Surely those who reject Allah’s revelations will suffer a severe
torment. For Allah is Almighty, capable of punishment.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
Obviously irrelevant to his translation.
</p></li>
<li>Quran 5:43–48: I will come to this in the next argument (it&rsquo;s irrelevant too).</li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://quran.com/5?startingVerse=68">Quran 5:68</a>:
</p>
<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Say, &ldquo;O People of the Scripture, you are [standing] on nothing until you uphold
[the law of] the Torah, the Gospel, and what has been revealed to you from your
Lord.&rdquo; And that which has been revealed to you from your Lord will surely
increase many of them in transgression and disbelief. So do not grieve over the
disbelieving people.
</p>

</blockquote></div></li>
<li><p>
<a href="https://quran.com/en/yunus/94">Quran 10:94</a>:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
If you are in doubt about [what] We have revealed to you, then ask those who
read the Scripture before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your
Lord, so do not be one of those who doubt,
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
This is the only verse that actually matches a little bit with his claim,
let&rsquo;s have a look at Tafseer at-Tabari of this verse which adds more context:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
[..] Allah said "if you are in doubt that the Jews started to differ [split into
believers and disbelievers] as was stated, then ask people who studied it before
you, like Abd Allah ibn Salam [also known as Abu Yousef The Israeli, he was one
of the jews who turned to Islam upon their knowledge of the Prophet] who are
honest [..]
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
What &ldquo;we have revealed&rdquo; to you here means the controversies that the Jews went
into, not &ldquo;Questions about God&rdquo; as Yliluoma claims. Why does Tabari
think so? because it&rsquo;s actually very obvious if you read the verse in its full
context, the verse right before it (<a href="https://al-quran.info/#10:93">Quran 10:93</a>) you will see how obvious it
is:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Certainly We settled the Children of Israel in a worthy settlement and We
provided them with all the good things, and they did not differ until [after]
the knowledge had come to them. Your Lord will indeed judge between them on the
Day of Resurrection concerning that about which they used to differ.
</p>

</blockquote></div></li>
</ul>

<p>
Now let&rsquo;s discuss <a href="https://quran.com/en/al-maidah/43">Quran 5:43-48</a>: (Yliluoma&rsquo;s translation)
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
But how is it that they come to <b>you</b> for judgement while they <b>have</b> the Torah,
in which <b>is</b> the judgement of Allah? Then they turn away, (even) after that;
but those are not (in fact) believers.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
He proceeds:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
There would be no point for God to say something like that, if the Jews and
Christians did not have the right text.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
Just like we did, if you look at the full context (starting from 5:40) you will
see how Quran is very consistent in fact, <a href="https://quran.com/5?startingVerse=41">Quran 5:41-43</a>
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
[&#x2026;] They distort the Scripture, taking rulings out of context, then say, “If
this is the ruling you get ˹from Muḥammad˺, accept it. If not, beware!” Whoever
Allah allows to be deluded, you can never be of any help to them against Allah.
It is not Allah’s Will to purify their hearts. For them is disgrace in this
world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter [.] They
eagerly listen to falsehood and consume forbidden gain. So if they come to you
˹O Prophet˺, either judge between them or turn away from them. If you turn away
from them, they cannot harm you whatsoever. But if you judge between them, then
do so with justice. Surely Allah loves those who are just.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
And finally:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
But why do they come to you for judgment when they ˹already˺ have the Torah
containing Allah’s judgment, then they turn away after all? They are not ˹true˺
believers.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
This verse shows how the Jews were contradicted, it is to say: if they indeed
had the right text, why would they seek the prophet as a reference? Because
their real Tawrat no longer exists: &ldquo;They distort the Scripture, taking rulings
out of context&rdquo;, the Jews were so confused between which was distorted and which
was from the original sheets, <a href="https://quran.com/6/91?translations=149,167,19,84">Quran 6:91</a> &ldquo;Who has sent down the Book brought by
Mūsā as a light and a guidance for people, which you keep in various sheets
(some of which) you disclose&rdquo; so they sought the prophet judgment as a valid
reference.
