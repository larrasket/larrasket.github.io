Open a command prompt, navigate to a convenient location, and create a folder named
partyinvites.  Navigate to the partyinvites folder and run the command shown in Listing 1-2
to start a new Go project.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>go mod init partyinvites
</code></pre>

<p>
The go command is used for almost every development task. This command creates a file named
<code>go.mod</code>, which is used to keep track of the packages a project depends on and can also be
used to publish the project, if required.
</p>

<p>
Go code files have a .go extension. Use your chosen editor to create a file named main.go in
the partyinvites folder with the contents shown in Listing 1-3. If you are using Visual
Studio Code and this is your first time editing a Go file, then you will be prompted to
install the extensions that support the Go language.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {
&#9474;   fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(<span style="color: #CC9393;">"</span><span style="color: #DFAF8F; font-weight: bold;">TODO:</span><span style="color: #CC9393;"> add some features"</span>)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The syntax of Go will be familiar if you have used any C or C-like language, such as C# or
Java. I describe the Go language in depth in this book, but you can discern a lot just by
looking at the keywords and structure of the code.
</p>


<p>
Features are grouped into packages, which is why there is a package statement in the
previous block.  Dependencies on packages are made using an import statement, which
allows the features they use to be accessed in a code file. Statements are grouped in
functions, which are defined with the func keyword. There is one function in the block
which is named main.  This is the entry point for the application, meaning that this is the
point at which execution will begin when the application is compiled and run.
</p>


<p>
Even though the details may not be familiar, the purpose of the code in the block is easy
to figure out: when the application is executed, it will write out a simple message. Run the
command shown in the partyinvites folder to compile and execute the project.
(Notice that there is a period after the word run in this command.)
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>go run .
</code></pre>

<p>
The go run command is useful during development because it performs the compilation and execution
tasks in one step. The application produces the following output:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>TODO: add some features
</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org732d736" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org732d736">Define a Data Type</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org732d736">
<p>
The next step is to create a custom data type that will represent the RSVP responses, as
shown:
</p>


<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">type</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">Rsvp</span> <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">struct</span> {
&#9474;   Name, Email, Phone <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">string</span>
&#9474;   WillAttend <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">bool</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Go allows custom types to be defined and given a name using the type keyword.
creates a struct data type named Rsvp. Structs allow a set of related values to be grouped
together. The Rsvp struct defines four fields, each of which has a name and a data type. The
data types used by the Rsvp fields are string and bool, which are the built-in types for
representing a string of characters and Boolean values.
</p>

<p>
Next, I need to collect Rsvp values together. Later, I explain how to use a
database in a Go application, but for this chapter, it will be enough to store the responses
in memory, which means that responses will be lost when the application is stopped.
</p>

<p>
Go has built-in support for fixed-length arrays, variable-length arrays (known as slices),
and maps that contain key-value pairs. the following block creates a slice, which is a good choice
when the number of values that will be stored isn’t known in advance.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">type</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">Rsvp</span> <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">struct</span> {
&#9474;   Name, Email, Phone <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">string</span>
&#9474;   WillAttend <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">bool</span>
}
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">var</span> <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">responses</span> = <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">make</span>([]*<span style="color: #7CB8BB;">Rsvp</span>, <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">0</span>, <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">10</span>)
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {
&#9474;   fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(<span style="color: #CC9393;">"</span><span style="color: #DFAF8F; font-weight: bold;">TODO:</span><span style="color: #CC9393;"> add some features"</span>);
}
</code></pre>


<p>
This new statement relies on several Go features, which are most readily understood by
starting at the end of the statement and working backwards.  Go provides built-in functions
for performing common operations on arrays, slices, and maps. One of those functions is
make, which is used in to initialize a new slice. The last two arguments to the
make function are the initial size and the initial capacity.
</p>


<p>
I specified zero for the size argument create an empty slice. Slices are resized
automatically as new items are added, and the initial capacity determines how many items can
be added before the slice has to be resized. In this case, ten items can be added to the
slice before it has to be resized.
</p>

<p>
The square brackets, <code>[]</code>, denote a slice. The asterisk, *, denotes a pointer. The Rsvp part
of the type denotes the struct type defined in Listing 1-6. Put together, []*Rsvp denotes a
slice of pointers to instances of the Rsvp struct.
</p>


<p>
You may have flinched at the term pointer if you have arrived at Go from C# or Java, which
do not allow pointers to be used directly. But you can relax because Go doesn’t allow the
types of operations on pointers that can get a developer into trouble.
The use of pointers in Go determines only whether a value is copied when it is
used. <b>By specifying that my slice will contain pointers, I am telling Go not to create
copies of my Rsvp values when I add them to the slice.</b>
</p>



<p>
The var keyword indicates that I am defining a new variable, which is given the name
responses. The equal sign, =, is the Go assignment operator and sets the value of the
responses variable to the newly created slice. I don’t have to specify the type of the
responses variable because the Go compiler will infer it from the value that is assigned to
it.

<h4 id="org6db7059">Creating a Go Project</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org6db7059">
<p>
Go projects don’t have an elaborate structure and are quick to set up. Open a new command
prompt and create a folder named tools in a convenient location. Add a file named main.go to
the tools folder with the content shown:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {
&#9474;   fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(<span style="color: #CC9393;">"Hello, Go"</span>)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The first statement is the package declaration. Packages are used to group related features, and every code
file has to declare the package to which its contents belong. The package declaration uses the package
keyword, followed by the name of the package.
</p>

<p>
The next statement is the import statement, which is used to declare dependencies on other
packages. The import keyword is followed by the name of the package, which is enclosed in
double quotes, as shown. The import statement  specifies a package named fmt, which is the
built-in Go package for reading and writing formatted strings. Check all the built-in
packages here: <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/std">https://pkg.go.dev/std</a>
</p>


<p>
The remaining statements in the main.go file define a function named main.  When you define
a function named main in a package named main, you create an entry point, which is where
execution begins in a command-line application

<h4 id="org04ecb8a">Semicolons and Errors in Go Code</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org04ecb8a">
<p>
You may have noticed that I didn&rsquo;t append a semicolon in the previous code.
Go has an unusual approach to semicolons: they are required to terminate code statements, but they
are not required in source code files. Instead, the Go build tools figure out where the semicolons need to
go as they process files, acting as though they had been added by the developer.
</p>

<p>
The result is that semicolons can be used in Go source code files but are not required and are
conventionally omitted.
</p>

<p>
Some oddities arise if you don’t follow the expected Go code style. For example, you will receive
compiler errors if you attempt to put the opening brace for a function or for loop on the next line,
like this:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {
&#9474;   fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(<span style="color: #CC9393;">"Hello, Go"</span>)
}
</code></pre>


<p>
The errors report an unexpected semicolon and a missing function body. This is because the Go tools
have automatically inserted a semicolon like this:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {
&#9474;   fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(<span style="color: #CC9393;">"Hello, Go"</span>)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The error messages make more sense when you understand why they arise, although it can be
hard to adjust to the expected code format if this is your preferred brace placement.
</p>

<p>
I have tried to follow the no-semicolon convention throughout this book, but I have been
writing code in languages that require semicolons for decades, so you may find the
occasional example where I have added semicolons purely by habit. The go fmt command will
remove semicolons and adjust other formatting issues.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org8323f43" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org8323f43">Defining a Module</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8323f43">
<p>
The previous section demonstrated that you can get `tarted just by creating a code file, but
a more common approach is to create a Go module, which is the conventional first step when
starting a new project. Creating a Go module allows a project to easily consume third-party
packages and can simplify the build process.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>go mod init tool
</code></pre>

<p>
This command adds a file named go.mod to the tools folder. The reason that most projects start with
the go mod init command is that it simplifies the build process. Instead of specifying a particular code file,
the project can be built and executed using a period, indicating the project in the current directory.

<div id="outline-container-org81b8fcd" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org81b8fcd">Linting Go Code</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org81b8fcd">
<p>
A linter is a tool that checks code files using a set of rules that describe problems that
cause confusion, produce unexpected results, or reduce the readability of the code. The most
widely used linter for Go is called golint, which applies rules taken from two sources. The
first is the Effective Go document produced by Google
(<a href="https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html">https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html</a>), which provides tips for writing clear and
concise Go code. The second source is a collection of comments from code reviews
(<a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments">https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments</a>).
</p>

<p>
The problem with golint is that it provides no configuration options and will always apply all the rules,
which can result in warnings you care about being lost in a long list of warnings for rules you don’t care
about. I prefer to use the revive linter package, which is a direct replacement for golint but with support
for controlling which rules are applied. To install the revive package, open a new command prompt and run
the command shown:
</p>
<pre class="code"><code>go install github.com/mgechev/revive@latest
</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org82b0891" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org82b0891">On Linting</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org82b0891">
<p>
Linters can be a powerful tool for good, especially in a development team with mixed levels of skill and
experience. Linters can detect common problems and subtle errors that lead to unexpected behavior
or long-term maintenance issues. I like this kind of linting, and I like to run my code through the linting
process after I have completed a major application feature or before I commit my code into version
control.
</p>

<p>
But linters can also be a tool of division and strife when rules are used to enforce one developer’s
personal preferences across an entire team. This is usually done under the banner of being
“opinionated.” The logic is that developers spend too much time arguing about different coding styles,
and everyone is better off being forced to write in the same way.
</p>

<p>
My experience is that developers will just find something else to argue about and that forcing
a code style is often just an excuse to make one person’s preferences mandatory for an entire
development team.
</p>

<p>
My advice is to use linting sparingly and focus on the issues that will cause real problems. Give
individual developers the freedom to express themselves naturally and focus only on issues that have
a discernible impact on the project. This is counter to the opinionated ethos of Go, but my view is that
productivity is not achieved by slavishly enforcing arbitrary rules, however well-intentioned they may be.

<p>
functions whose names start with an uppercase letter are said to be exported and available

functions is to provide a descriptive comment. The linter has flagged the fact that no
comments exist for the PrintHello and PrintNumber functions.

<p>
The syntax required to control the linter is revive, followed by a colon, enable or disable,
and optionally another colon and the name of a linter rule. So, for example, the
<code>revive:disable:exported</code> comment prevents the linter from enforcing a rule named exported,
which is the rule that has been generating warnings. The <code>revive:enable:exported</code> comment
enables the rule so that it will be applied to subsequent statements in the code file.
</p>

<p>
Using code comments is helpful when you want to suppress warnings for a specific region of code but still
apply the rule elsewhere in the project. If you don’t want to apply a rule at all, then you can use a TOML-
format configuration file. Add a file named revive.toml to the tools folder with the content
shown:

The go vet command identifies statements likely to be mistakes. Unlike a linter, which will
often focus on style issues, the go vet command finds code that compiles but that probably
won’t do what the developer intended.
</p>

<p>
I like the go vet command because it spots errors that other tools miss, although the
analyzers don’t spot every mistake and will sometimes highlight code that isn’t a problem.
</p>

<p>
Look at the following example:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main

<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>

<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {
&#9474;   <span style="color: #93E0E3;">PrintHello</span>()
&#9474;   <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">for</span> <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">i</span> := <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">0</span>; i &lt; <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">5</span>; i++ {
&#9474;   &#9474;   i = i
&#9474;   &#9474;   <span style="color: #93E0E3;">PrintNumber</span>(i)
&#9474;   }
}

<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">PrintHello</span>() {
&#9474;   fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Print</span>(<span style="color: #CC9393;">"Hello, Go"</span>)
}

<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">PrintNumber</span>(<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">number</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">int</span>) {
&#9474;   fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Print</span>(number)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The new statement assigns the variable i to itself, which is allowed by the Go compiler but is likely to be
a mistake. To analyze the code, use the command prompt to run the command:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>go vet main.go
</code></pre>

<pre class="code"><code># party
.\main.go:8:3: self-assignment of i to i
</code></pre>

<p>
The warnings produced by the go vet command specify the location in the code where a problem has
been detected and provide a description of the issue.
</p>

<p>
The go vet command applies multiple analyzers to code, and you can see the list of analyzers
at <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/vet">https://golang.org/cmd/vet</a>. You can select individual analyzers to enable or disable, but
it can be difficult to know which analyzer has generated a specific message. To figure out
which analyzer is responsible for a warning, run the command:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>go vet -json .
</code></pre>
<pre class="code"><code># party
{
    <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">"party"</span>: {
        <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">"assign"</span>: [
            {

                <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">"message"</span>: <span style="color: #CC9393;">"self-assignment of i to i"</span>
            }

    }

<p>
Constants are names for specific values, which allows them to be used repeatedly and
consistently. There are two ways to define constants in Go: typed constants and untyped
constants. This is an example of typed constants:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> (
&#9474;   <span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>
&#9474;   <span style="color: #5F7F5F;">//</span><span style="color: #7F9F7F;">"math/rand"</span>
)
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {
&#9474;   <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">const</span> <span style="color: #BFEBBF;">price</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">float32</span> = <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">275.00</span>
&#9474;   <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">const</span> <span style="color: #BFEBBF;">tax</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">float32</span> = <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">27.50</span>
&#9474;   <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">const</span> <span style="color: #BFEBBF;">quantity</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">int</span> = <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">2</span>
&#9474;   fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(<span style="color: #CC9393;">"Total:"</span>, quantity * (price + tax))
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The difference between typed and untyped constants is that, and since go has a very strict
rules about type conversions, untyped will have some kind of conversions.
The above code should gives the following error:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>.\main.go:12:26: invalid operation: quantity * (price + tax) (mismatched types int and float32)
</code></pre>


<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> (
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>

)
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {
<span style="color: #BFEBBF;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;const</span> <span style="color: #BFEBBF;">price</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">float32</span> = <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">275.00</span>
<span style="color: #BFEBBF;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;const</span> <span style="color: #BFEBBF;">tax</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">float32</span> = <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">27.50</span>
<span style="color: #BFEBBF;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;const</span> <span style="color: #BFEBBF;">quantity</span> = <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">2</span>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(<span style="color: #CC9393;">"Total:"</span>, quantity * (price + tax))
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Omitting the type when defining the quantity constant tells the Go compiler that it should
be more flexible about the constant’s type. When the expression passed to the fmt.Println
function is evaluated, the Go compiler will convert the quantity value to a float32. Compile
and execute the code, and you will receive the following output:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>Total: 605
</code></pre>


<p>
Untyped constants will be converted only if the value can be represented in the target type.
In practice, this means you can mix untyped integer and floating-point numeric values, but
conversions between other data types must be done explicitly.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> (
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>

}
</code></pre>

<p>
The const keyword is followed by a comma-separated list of names, an equal sign, and a
comma separated list of values.
</p>

<p>
Untyped constants may seem like an odd feature, but they make working with Go a lot easier,
and you will find yourself relying on this feature, often without realizing, because literal
values are untyped constants, which means that you can use literal values in expressions and
rely on the compiler to deal with mismatched types, as shown:
</p>

</code></pre>

<p>
Variables are declared using the var keyword, a name, a type, and a value assignment, as
illustrated:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main

<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>

<p>
The Go compiler can infer the type of variables based on the initial value, which allows the

<h5 id="org281c383">Short Variable Declaration Syntax</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org281c383">
<p>
The short variable declaration provides a shorthand for declaring variables, as shown:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {
<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;price</span> := <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">275.00</span>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(price)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Multiple variables can be defined with a single statement by creating comma-separated lists of names
and values, as shown:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {
<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;price</span>, <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">tax</span>, <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">inStock</span> := <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">275.00</span>, <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">27.50</span>, <span style="color: #BFEBBF;">true</span>

}
</code></pre>

<p>
Go doesn’t usually allow variables to be redefined but makes a limited exception when the
short syntax is used. To demonstrate the default behavior, the following block uses the var
keyword to define a variable that has the same name as one that already exists within the
same function
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {
<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;price</span>, <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">tax</span>, <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">inStock</span> := <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">275.00</span>, <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">27.50</span>, <span style="color: #BFEBBF;">true</span>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(<span style="color: #CC9393;">"Total:"</span>, price + tax)
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(<span style="color: #CC9393;">"In stock:"</span>, inStock)
<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;var</span> <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">price2</span>, <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">tax</span> = <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">200.00</span>, <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">25.00</span>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(<span style="color: #CC9393;">"Total 2:"</span>, price2 + tax)
}
</code></pre>


<p>
This gives:
</p>
<pre class="code"><code>.\main.go:10:17: tax redeclared in this block
</code></pre>

<p>
However, redefining a variable is allowed if the short syntax is used, as shown as long as
at least one of the other variables being defined doesn’t already exist and the type of the
variable doesn’t change.
</p>
<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main

It is illegal in Go to define a variable and not use it:

<pre class="code"><code>.\main.go:6:26: discount declared but not used

</code></pre>

<p>
One way to resolve this problem is to remove the unused variables, but this isn’t always
possible. For these situations, Go provides the blank identifier, which is used to denote a
value that won’t be used, as shown:
</p>
<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>

<h4 id="orgf319fc9">Pointers</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf319fc9">
<p>
Pointers are often misunderstood, especially if you have come to Go from a language such as
Java or C#, where pointers are used behind the scenes but carefully hidden from the
developer. To understand how pointers work, the best place to start is understanding what Go
does when pointers are not used, as shown:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {
<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;first</span> := <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">100</span>
<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;second</span> := first;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;first++
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(<span style="color: #CC9393;">"First:"</span>, first)
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(<span style="color: #CC9393;">"Second:"</span>, second)
}
</code></pre>


<p>
The previous code creates two variables. The value of the variable named first is set using
a string literal. The value of the variable named second is set using the first value.
</p>

<p>
Go copies the current value of first when creating second, after which these variables are
independent of one another. Each variable is a reference to a separate memory location where
its value is stored
</p>

<p>
When I use the ++ operator to increment the first variable, Go reads the value at the memory
location associated with the variable, increments the value, and stores it at the same
memory location. The value assigned to the second variable remains the same because the
change affects only the value stored by the first variable.
</p>


<p>
Pointers have a bad reputation because of pointer arithmetic. Pointers store memory
locations as numeric values, which means they can be manipulated using arithmetic operators,
providing access to other memory locations. You can start with a location that points to an
int value, for example; increment the value by the number of bits used to store an int; and
read the adjacent value. This can be useful but can cause unexpected results, such as trying
to access the wrong location or a location outside of the memory allocated to the program.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org6e9e033" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="org6e9e033">Some Operators</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org6e9e033">
<p>
Go doesn’t allow types to be mixed in operations and will not automatically convert types,
except in the case of untyped constants. To show how the compiler responds to mixed data
types, Following contains a statement that applies the addition operator to values of
different types.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> (
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>
<span style="color: #5F7F5F;">//&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><span style="color: #7F9F7F;">"math"</span>
)
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {
<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;kayak</span> := <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">275</span>
<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;soccerBall</span> := <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">19.50</span>
<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;total</span> := kayak + soccerBall
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(total)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
The literal values used to define the kayak and soccerBall variables result in an int value
and a float64 value, which are then used in the addition operation to set the value of the
total variable. When the code is compiled, the following error will be reported:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">.</span>\main.go:13:20: invalid operation: kayak + soccerBall <span style="color: #8CD0D3;">(</span>mismatched types int and float64<span style="color: #8CD0D3;">)</span>
</code></pre>

<p>
For such a simple example, I could simply change the literal value used to initialize the
kayak variable to 275.00, which would produce a float64 variable. But types are rarely as
easy to change in real projects, which is why Go provides the features described in the
sections that follow.
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main

<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> (
&#9474;   <span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>

&#9474;   fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(total)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Explicit conversions can be used only when the value can be represented in the target type.
This means you can convert between numeric types and between strings and runes, but other
combinations, such as converting int values to bool values, are not supported.

<h4 id="org33e7576">Flow Control</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org33e7576">
<p>
The flow of execution in a Go application is simple to understand, especially when the
application is as simple as the example. The statements defined in the special main
function, known as the application’s entry point, are executed in the order in which they
are defined. Once these statements have all been executed, the application exits.
Example:
</p>
<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {
&#9474;   <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">kayakPrice</span> := <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">275.00</span>
&#9474;   <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">if</span> kayakPrice &gt; <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">100</span> {
&#9474;   &#9474;   fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(<span style="color: #CC9393;">"Price is greater than 100"</span>)
&#9474;   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Go allows an if statement to use an initialization statement, which is executed before the
if statement’s expression is evaluated. The initialization statement is restricted to a Go
simple statement, which means—in broad terms—that the statement can define a new variable,
assign a new value to an existing variable, or invoke a function

<p>
Array types include the size of the array in square brackets, followed by the type of
element that the array will contain, known as the underlying type.The length and element
type of an array cannot be changed, and the array length must be specified as a constant.
(Slices store a variable number of values.)
</p>

<p>
Arrays can be defined and populated in a single statement using the literal syntax:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {
<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;names</span> := [<span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">3</span>]<span style="color: #7CB8BB;">string</span> { <span style="color: #CC9393;">"Kayak"</span>, <span style="color: #CC9393;">"Lifejacket"</span>, <span style="color: #CC9393;">"Paddle"</span> }
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(names)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
When using the literal syntax, the compiler can infer the length of the array from the list of elements,
like this:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #DFAF8F;">names</span> := [...]<span style="color: #7CB8BB;">string</span> { <span style="color: #CC9393;">"Kayak"</span>, <span style="color: #CC9393;">"Lifejacket"</span>, <span style="color: #CC9393;">"Paddle"</span> }
</code></pre>

<p>
The explicit length is replaced with three periods (&#x2026;), which tells the compiler to determine the array
length from the literal values. The type of the names variable is still [3]string, and the only difference
is that you can add or remove literal values without also having to update the explicitly specified length.
I don’t use this feature for the examples in this book because I want to make the types used as clear as
possible.
</p>


<p>
Arrays are enumerated using the for and range keywords:
</p>
<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main

<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> (

<p>
The best way to think of slices is as a variable-length array because they are useful when
you don’t know how many values you need to store or when the number changes over time. One
way to define a slice is to use the built-in make function
</p>

The length is not part of the slice type because the size of slices can vary, as I

<p>
The combination of the slice type and the length is used to create an array, which acts as
the data store for the slice. The slice is a data structure that contains three values: a
pointer to the array, the length of the slice, and the capacity of the slice. The length of
the slice is the number of elements that it can store, and the capacity is the number of
elements that can be stored in the array. In this example, the length and the capacity are
both 3:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {
<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;names</span> := []<span style="color: #7CB8BB;">string</span> {<span style="color: #CC9393;">"Kayak"</span>, <span style="color: #CC9393;">"Lifejacket"</span>, <span style="color: #CC9393;">"Paddle"</span>}
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;names = <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">append</span>(names, <span style="color: #CC9393;">"Hat"</span>, <span style="color: #CC9393;">"Gloves"</span>)
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(names)
}
</code></pre>


<p>
Creating and copying arrays can be inefficient. If you expect that you will need to append
items to a slice, you can specify additional capacity when using the make function:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {
<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;names</span> := <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">make</span>([]<span style="color: #7CB8BB;">string</span>, <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">3</span>, <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">6</span>)
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;names[<span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">0</span>] = <span style="color: #CC9393;">"Kayak"</span>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;names[<span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">1</span>] = <span style="color: #CC9393;">"Lifejacket"</span>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;names[<span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">2</span>] = <span style="color: #CC9393;">"Paddle"</span>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(<span style="color: #CC9393;">"len:"</span>, <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">len</span>(names))
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(<span style="color: #CC9393;">"cap:"</span>, <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">cap</span>(names))
}
</code></pre>


<p>
As noted earlier, slices have a length and a capacity. The length of a slice is how many
values it can currently contain, while the number of elements that can be stored in the
underlying array before the slice must be resized and a new array created. The capacity will
always be at least the length but can be larger if additional capacity has been allocated
with the make function. The call to the make function creates a slice with a
length of 3 and a capacity of 6.
</p>



<p>
Slices can be created using existing arrays, which builds on the behavior described in
earlier examples and emphasizes the nature of slices as views onto arrays

<p>
Go doesn’t differentiate between structs and classes, in the way that other languages do.
All custom data types are defined as structs, and the decision to pass them by reference or
by value is made depending on whether a pointer is used. As I explained in Chapter 4, this
achieves the same effect as having separate type categories but with the additional
flexibility of allowing the choice to be made every time a value is used. It does, however,
require more diligence from the programmer, who must think through the consequences of that
choice during coding. Neither approach is better, and the results are essentially the same.

<h3 id="orgaad5a15">Interfaces</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgaad5a15">
<p>
All the types we&rsquo;ve looked at so far have been concrete types. A concrete type specifies the
exact representation of its values and exposes the intrinsic operations of that
representation, such as arithmetic for numbers, or indexing, append, and range for slices. A
concrete type may also provide additional behaviors through its methods. When you have a
value of a con- crete type, you know exactly what it is and what you can do with i
</p>

<p>
There is another kind of type in Go called an inferface type. An interface is an abstract
type. It doesn&rsquo;t expose the representation or internal structure of its values, or the set
of basic operations they support; it reveals only some of their methods. When you have a
value of an interface type, you know nothing about what it is; you know only what it can do,
or more precisely, what behaviors are provided by its methods.

The first step for all the example projects in this book has been to create a module file,
which was done with the command:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>go mod init &lt;name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
The original purpose of a module file was to enable code to be published so that it can be
used in other projects and, potentially, by other developers. Module files are still used
for this purpose, but Go has started to gain mainstream development, and as this has
happened, the percentage of projects that are published has fallen. These days, the most
common reason for creating a module file is that it makes it easy to install packages that
have been published and has the bonus effect of allowing the use of the run command rather
than having to provide the Go build tools with a list of individual files to compile.

That command created a file named go.mod in the packages folder, with the
following content:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>module pkg

go 1.18
</code></pre>

<p>
The module statement specifies the name of the module, which was specified by the command
in. This name is important because it is used to import features from other packages created
within the same project and third-party packages, as later examples will demonstrate. The go
statement specifies the version of Go that is used, which is 1.17 for this book.
</p>

<p>
Packages make it possible to add structure to a project so that related features are grouped
together. Create the packages/store folder and add to it a file named product.go, with the
contents shown in:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> store

<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">type</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">Product</span> <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">struct</span> {
&#9474;   Name, Category <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">string</span>
&#9474;   price          <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">int</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>
And use it in your main:
</p>
<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main

<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> (
&#9474;   <span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>
&#9474;   <span style="color: #CC9393;">"packges/store"</span>
)

<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {
&#9474;   <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">pr</span> := <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">store.Product</span>{
&#9474;   &#9474;   <span style="color: #BFEBBF;">Name</span>:     <span style="color: #CC9393;">"o"</span>,
&#9474;   &#9474;   <span style="color: #BFEBBF;">Category</span>: <span style="color: #CC9393;">"fr"</span>,
&#9474;   }
&#9474;   fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Print</span>(pr)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Packages can contain multiple code files, and to simplify development, access control rules
and package prefixes do not apply when accessing features defined in the same package. Add a
file named tax.go to the store folder with the contents shown:
</p>
<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> store
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">const</span> <span style="color: #BFEBBF;">defaultTaxRate</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">float64</span> = <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">0.2</span>
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">const</span> <span style="color: #BFEBBF;">minThreshold</span> = <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">10</span>
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">type</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">taxRate</span> <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">struct</span> {
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;rate, threshold <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">float64</span>
}

<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">newTaxRate</span>(<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">rate</span>, <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">threshold</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">float64</span>) *<span style="color: #7CB8BB;">taxRate</span> {

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;}
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">return</span> &amp;taxRate { rate, threshold }
}
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> (<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">taxRate</span> *<span style="color: #7CB8BB;">taxRate</span>) <span style="color: #93E0E3;">calcTax</span>(<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">product</span> *<span style="color: #7CB8BB;">Product</span>) <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">float64</span> {

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">return</span> product.price + (product.price * taxRate.rate)

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">return</span> product.price
}
</code></pre>

<p>
All the features defined in the tax.go file are unexported, which means they can be used
only within the store package. Notice that the calcTax method can access the price field of
the Product type and that it does so without having to refer to the type as store.Product
because it is in the same package:
</p>

<h4 id="org872e74e">Package Conflicts</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org872e74e">
<p>
When a package is imported, the combination of the module name and package name ensures that
the package is uniquely identified. But only the package name is used when accessing the
features provided by the package, which can lead to conflicts. To see how this problem
arises, create the packages/fmt folder and add to it a file named formats.go with the code
shown:
</p>
<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> fmt
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: #CC9393;">"strconv"</span>
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">ToCurrency</span>(<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">amount</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">float64</span>) <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">string</span> {
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">return</span> <span style="color: #CC9393;">"$"</span> + strconv.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">FormatFloat</span>(amount, <span style="color: #CC9393;">'f'</span>, <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">2</span>, <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">64</span>)
}
</code></pre>

<p>
This will never compile:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>go run .
<span style="color: #5F7F5F;"># </span><span style="color: #7F9F7F;">packges</span>
./main.go:5:2: fmt redeclared<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;"> in</span> this block
    ./main.go:4:2: other declaration of fmt
./main.go:5:2: imported and not used: <span style="color: #CC9393;">"packges/fmt"</span>
</code></pre>

<p>
One way to deal with package name conflicts is to use an alias, which allows a package to be
accessed using a different name, as shown:
</p>
<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;currencyFmt <span style="color: #CC9393;">"packages/fmt"</span>
)
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {
<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;product</span> := store.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">NewProduct</span>(<span style="color: #CC9393;">"Kayak"</span>, <span style="color: #CC9393;">"Watersports"</span>, <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">279</span>)

}
</code></pre>

<p>
There is a special alias, known as the dot import, that allows a package’s features to be
used without using a prefix, as shown:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> (

Go prevents packages from being imported but not used, which can be a problem if you rely on
the effect of an initialization function but don’t need to use any of the features the

The initialization function writes out a message when it is invoked for the purposes of this

If you are used to languages such as C# or Java, then you will have created a base class and
created subclasses to add more specific features. The subclasses inherit functionality from
the base class, which prevents code duplication. The result is a set of classes, where the
base class defines common functionality that is supplemented by more specific features in
individual subclasses.
</p>


<p>
The starting point is to define a struct type and a method, which I will use to create more
specific types in later examples. Create the composition/store folder and add to it a file
named product.go with the content shown:
</p>

<p>
Because Go doesn’t support classes, it doesn’t support class constructors either. As I
explained, a common convention is to define a constructor function whose name is New&lt;Type&gt;,
such as NewProduct, as shown, and that allows values to be provided for all fields, even
those that have not been exported. As with other code features, the capitalization of the
first letter of the constructor function name determines whether it is exported outside of
the package.

Constructor functions are only a convention, and their use is not enforced, which means that
exported types can be created using the literal syntax, just as long as no values are
assigned to the unexported fields.  This shows the use of the constructor function
and the literal syntax:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main

<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> (
&#9474;   <span style="color: #CC9393;">"comps/store"</span>
&#9474;   <span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>
)

<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {

&#9474;   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Constructors should be used whenever they are defined because they make it easier to manage
changes in the way that values are created and because they ensure that fields are properly
initialized. Using the literal syntax means that no value is assigned to the price field,
which affects the output from the Price method. But, since Go doesn’t support enforcing the
use of constructors, their use requires discipline.
</p>

<p>
Go supports composition, rather than inheritance, which is done by combining struct types.
Add a file named boat.go to the store folder with the contents shown:

Go has excellent support for writing concurrent applications, using features that are

the use of <code>goroutines</code>, which allow functions to be executed concurrently, and channels,

This file defines a custom type named Product, along with type aliases that I use to create
a map that organizes products by category. I use the Product type in a slice and a map, and
I rely on an init function, to populate the map from the contents of the slice, which is
itself populated using the literal syntax. This file also contains a ToCurrency function
that formats float64 values into dollar currency strings, which I will use to format the
results in this chapter. Add another file called <code>operation.go</code>:

<p>
The key building block for executing a Go program is the <code>goroutine</code>, which is a lightweight
thread created by the Go runtime. All Go programs use at least one <code>goroutine</code> because this is
how Go executes the code in the main function. When compiled Go code is executed, the
runtime creates a <code>goroutine</code> that starts executing the statements in the entry point, which
is the main function in the main package. Each statement in the main function is executed in
the order in which they are defined. The <code>goroutine</code> keeps executing statements until it
reaches the end of the main function, at which point the application terminates.
</p>


<p>
The <code>goroutine</code> executes each statement in the main function synchronously, which means that
it waits for the statement to complete before moving on to the next statement. The
statements in the main function can call other functions, use for loops, create values, and
use all the other features. The main <code>goroutine</code> will work its way through the code, following
its path by executing one statement at a time.
</p>


<p>
Follows adds a statement that writes out details of each product as it is processed, which
will demonstrate the flow shown in the figure:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> (<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">group</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">ProductGroup</span>) <span style="color: #93E0E3;">TotalPrice</span>(<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">category</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">string</span>) (<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">total</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">float64</span>) {
&#9474;   <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">for</span> <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">_</span>, <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">p</span> := <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">range</span> group {
&#9474;   &#9474;   fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Printf</span>(category, <span style="color: #CC9393;">"product"</span>, p.Name)
&#9474;   &#9474;   total += p.Price
&#9474;   }
&#9474;   fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(category, <span style="color: #CC9393;">"subtotal:"</span>, <span style="color: #93E0E3;">ToCurrency</span>(total))
&#9474;   <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">return</span>
}
</code></pre>

<p>
You may see different results based on the order in which keys are retrieved from the map,
but what’s important is that all the products in a category are processed before execution
moves onto the next category.  The advantages of synchronous execution are simplicity and
consistency—the behavior of synchronous code is easy to understand and predictable. The
disadvantage is that it can be inefficient. Working sequentially through nine data items, as
in the example, doesn’t present any issues, but most real projects have larger volumes of
data or have other tasks to perform, which means that sequential execution takes too long
and doesn’t produce results fast enough.
</p>


<p>
Go allows the developer to create additional goroutines, which execute code at the same time
as the main <code>goroutine</code>. Go makes it easy to create new goroutines, as shown:
</p>

<p>
A <code>goroutine</code> is created using the go keyword followed by the function or method that should
be executed asynchronously.
</p>

<p>
When the Go runtime encounters the go keyword, it creates a new goroutine and uses it to
execute the specified function or method.  This changes the program execution because, at
any given moment, there are multiple goroutines, each of which is executing its own set of
statements. These statements are executed concurrently, which just means they are being
executed at the same time.  In the case of the example, a goroutine is created for each call
to the TotalPrice method, which means that the categories are processed concurrently.
</p>



<p>
Getting a result from a function that is being executed asynchronously can be complicated
because it requires coordination between the goroutine that produces the result and the
goroutine that consumes the result.  To address this issue, Go provides channels, which are
conduits through which data can be sent and received. I am going to introduce a channel into
the example in steps:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main

</code></pre>


<p>
Channels are strongly typed, which means that they will carry values of a specified type or
interface. The type for a channel is the chan keyword, followed by the type the channel will
carry.  Channels are created using the built-in make function, specifying the channel type.
</p>

<p>
I used the full variable declaration syntax in this listing to emphasize the type, which is
chan float64, meaning a channel that will carry float64 values.
</p>

<p>
The next step is to update the TotalPrice method so that it sends its result through the
channel, as shown:
</p>
<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> (<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">group</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">ProductGroup</span>) <span style="color: #93E0E3;">TotalPrice</span>(<span style="color: #DFAF8F;">category</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">string</span>, <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">resultChannel</span> <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">chan</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">float64</span>)<span style="color: #7CB8BB;">&#160;&#160;</span>{

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;resultChannel &lt;- total
}
</code></pre>

<p>
By default, sending and receiving through a channel are blocking operations. This means a
goroutine that sends a value will not execute any further statements until another goroutine
receives the value from the channel. If a second goroutine sends a value, it will be blocked
until the channel is cleared, causing a queue of goroutines waiting for values to be
received. This happens in the other direction, too, so that goroutines that receive values

<p>
The default channel behavior can lead to bursts of activity as goroutines do their work,
followed by a long idle period waiting for messages to be received. This doesn’t have an
impact on the example application because the goroutines finish once their messages are
received, but in a real project goroutines often have repetitive tasks to perform, and
waiting for a receiver can cause a performance bottleneck.
</p>


<p>
An alternative approach is to create a channel with a buffer, which is used to accept values
from a sender and store them until a receiver becomes available. This makes sending a
message a nonblocking operation, allowing a sender to pass its value to the channel and
continue working without having to wait for a receiver. This is similar to Alice having an
inbox on her desk. Senders come to Alice’s office and put their message into the inbox,
leaving it for Alice to read when she is ready. But, if the inbox is full, then they will
have to wait until she has processed some of her backlog before sending a new message.
</p>


<p>
It is possible to create bidirectional as well as uni-directional channels in golang. A
channel can be created to which we can only send data, as well as a channel, can be created
from which we can only receive data. This is determined by the direction of the arrow of the
channel. The direction of the arrow for a channel specifies the direction of flow of data
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>chan</code>  :bidirectional channel (Both read and write)</li>
<li><code>chan &lt;-</code>  :only writing to channel</li>
<li><code>&lt;- chan</code>  :only reading from channel (input channel)</li>
</ul>

The simplest use for select statements is to receive from a channel without blocking,
ensuring that a goroutine won’t have to wait when the channel is empty.

Go makes it easy to express exceptional conditions, which allows a function or method to
indicate to the calling code that something has gone wrong. As an example this adds
statements that produce a problematic response from the <code>TotalPrice</code> method

A module is a collection of Go packages stored in a file tree with a go.mod file at its
root. The go.mod file defines the module’s module path, which is also the import path used
for the root directory, and its dependency requirements, which are the other modules needed
for a successful build. Each dependency requirement is written as a module path and a
specific semantic version.
</p>

<p>
As of Go 1.11, the go command enables the use of modules when the current directory or any
parent directory has a go.mod, provided the directory is outside <code>$GOPATH/src</code>. (Inside
<code>$GOPATH/src</code>, for compatibility, the go command still runs in the old <code>GOPATH</code> mode, even
if a go.mod is found. See the go command documentation for details.) Starting in Go 1.13,
module mode will be the default for all development.

At this point, the directory contains a package, but not a module, because there is no
<code>go.mod</code> file. If we were working in <code>/home/gopher/hello</code> and ran <code>go test</code> now, we’d see:
</p>

<pre class="example">
$ go test
PASS
ok      _/home/gopher/hello 0.020s
$
</pre>


<p>
The primary motivation for Go modules was to improve the experience of using (that is,
adding a dependency on) code written by other developers.

<p>
An error is an abnormal, unexpected condition which occurs in the program. In programming,
errors are often called bugs. The process of finding and resolving bugs is called debugging.
Go provide tools for dealing with errors. Errors in Go are plain values. Therefore, errors
can be stored in variables, passed as parameters to functions, or returned from functions.
</p>

<p>
Errors are represented using the built-in error type.
</p>

<p>
Most Go functions return an error value among its return values. (Go supports multiple
return values.) It is our responsibility to check this error value. A value of nil means
there is no error. By convention, the error value is the rightmost value among the returned

The idiomatic way of handling errors is to check for error right after the function call.

<p>
A panic is a runtime-error that we are not prepared to handle gracefully. A panic can occur
for example when we try to divide by zero or try to access non-existing array index.
</p>

<p>
A stack trace is a report of the active stack frames at a certain point in time during the
execution of a program. A panic is Go prints the stack trace to the console, assisting us in
debugging.

<p>
If you are trying to learn Go or if you are building a PoC or a simple project for yourself
this project layout is an overkill. Start with something really simple instead (a single
main.gofile andgo.mod is more than enough). As your project grows keep in mind that it&rsquo;ll be
important to make sure your code is well structured otherwise you&rsquo;ll end up with a messy
code with lots of hidden dependencies and global state. When you have more people working on
the project you&rsquo;ll need even more structure. That&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s important to introduce a
common way to manage packages/libraries. When you have an open source project or when you
know other projects import the code from your project repository that&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s important
to have private (aka internal) packages and code. Clone the repository, keep what you need
and delete everything else! Just because it&rsquo;s there it doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to use it all.
None of these patterns are used in every single project. Even the vendor pattern is not
universal.

<p>
The directory name for each application should match the name of the executable you want to
have (e.g., /cmd/myapp).
</p>

<p>
Don&rsquo;t put a lot of code in the application directory. If you think the code can be imported
and used in other projects, then it should live in the /pkg directory. If the code is not
reusable or if you don&rsquo;t want others to reuse it, put that code in the /internal directory.
You&rsquo;ll be surprised what others will do, so be explicit about your intentions!

at any level of your project tree.

Library code that&rsquo;s ok to use by external applications (e.g., /pkg/mypubliclib). Other
projects will import these libraries expecting them to work, so think twice before you put
something here :-) Note that the internal directory is a better way to ensure your private
packages are not importable because it&rsquo;s enforced by Go. The /pkg directory is still a good
way to explicitly communicate that the code in that directory is safe for use by others. The
I&rsquo;ll take pkg over internal blog post by Travis Jeffery provides a good overview of the pkg
and internal directories and when it might make sense to use them.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf3ed8d6">
<p>
If you’ve worked with Go for sometime, you have probably encountered the <code>omitempty</code> tag,
when trying to encode a struct to JSON.
</p>

<p>
When using Go to build web applications, or HTTP servers, there will eventually come a time
when we need to encode some data as JSON. The problem here is that the JSON representation
does not exactly match the way Go handles data.
</p>

<p>
One key difference, is that in a struct, there are always clearly defined fields, while in
JSON there are not. For example, consider describing a dog as a struct in Go:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">type</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">Dog</span> <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">struct</span> {
&#9474;   Breed <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">string</span>
&#9474;   WeightKg <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">int</span>
}
</code></pre>


<p>
Now, if we were to initialize, encode to JSON, and print a sample dog :
</p>
<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {
&#9474;   <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">d</span> := <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">Dog</span>{
&#9474;   &#9474;   <span style="color: #BFEBBF;">Breed</span>:    <span style="color: #CC9393;">"dalmation"</span>,
&#9474;   &#9474;   <span style="color: #BFEBBF;">WeightKg</span>: <span style="color: #DCDCDC; font-weight: bold;">45</span>,
&#9474;   }
&#9474;   <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">b</span>, <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">_</span> := json.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Marshal</span>(d)
&#9474;   fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(<span style="color: #93E0E3;">string</span>(b))
}
</code></pre>


<p>
We would get the output: <code>{"Breed":"dalmation","WeightKg":45}</code>
</p>

<p>
Now, a dog for whom we do not have the weight, would be slightly awkward to deal with:
</p>


<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {
&#9474;   <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">d</span> := <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">Dog</span>{
&#9474;   &#9474;   <span style="color: #BFEBBF;">Breed</span>:    <span style="color: #CC9393;">"pug"</span>,
&#9474;   }
&#9474;   <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">b</span>, <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">_</span> := json.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Marshal</span>(d)
&#9474;   fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(<span style="color: #93E0E3;">string</span>(b))
}
</code></pre>



<p>
This prints <code>{"Breed":"pug","WeightKg":0}</code>, even though the weight of of pug was unknown. A
better option would be to print <code>"WeightKg":null</code>, or to not have the WeightKg key at all.
</p>


<p>
This is where the omitempty tag helps us. Let’s add the <code>omitempty</code> tag to our Dog struct:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">type</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">Dog</span> <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">struct</span> {
&#9474;   Breed    <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">string</span>
&#9474;   <span style="color: #5F7F5F;">// </span><span style="color: #7F9F7F;">The first comma below is to separate the name tag from the omitempty tag</span>
&#9474;   WeightKg <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">int</span> <span style="color: #CC9393;">`json:",omitempty"`</span>
}
</code></pre>


<p>
Now, if <code>WeightKg</code> is set to it’s default value (which is 0 for the int type), the key
itself will be omitted from the JSON object.
</p>

<p>
The same will happen if a string is empty &ldquo;&rdquo;, or if a pointer is nil, or if a slice has zero
elements in it.
</p>

<p>
In cases where an empty value does not exist, omitempty is of no use. An embedded struct,
for example, does not have an empty value:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code>
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">import</span> (
&#9474;   <span style="color: #CC9393;">"encoding/json"</span>
&#9474;   <span style="color: #CC9393;">"fmt"</span>
)

<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">type</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">dimension</span> <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">struct</span> {
&#9474;   Height <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">int</span>
&#9474;   Width <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">int</span>
&#9474;   }
&#9474;
<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">type</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">Dog</span> <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">struct</span> {
&#9474;   Breed    <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">string</span>
&#9474;   WeightKg <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">int</span>
&#9474;   Size <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">dimension</span> <span style="color: #CC9393;">`json:",omitempty"`</span>
}

<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {
&#9474;   <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">d</span> := <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">Dog</span>{
&#9474;   &#9474;   <span style="color: #BFEBBF;">Breed</span>: <span style="color: #CC9393;">"pug"</span>,
&#9474;   }
&#9474;   <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">b</span>, <span style="color: #DFAF8F;">_</span> := json.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Marshal</span>(d)
&#9474;   fmt.<span style="color: #93E0E3;">Println</span>(<span style="color: #93E0E3;">string</span>(b))
}

</code></pre>


<p>
In this case, even though we never set the value of the Size attribute, and set its
<code>omitempty</code> tag, it still appears in the output. This is because structs do not have any empty
value in Go. To solve this, use a struct pointer instead :
</p>


<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">type</span> <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">Dog</span> <span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">struct</span> {
&#9474;   Breed    <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">string</span>
&#9474;   WeightKg <span style="color: #7CB8BB;">int</span>
&#9474;   <span style="color: #5F7F5F;">// </span><span style="color: #7F9F7F;">Now `Size` is a pointer to a `dimension` instance</span>
&#9474;   Size *<span style="color: #7CB8BB;">dimension</span> <span style="color: #CC9393;">`json:",omitempty"`</span>

To sort a slice in reverse order, you can use the <code>Reverse()</code> function along with <code>StringSlice</code>,
<code>IntSlice</code>, and <code>Float64Slice</code> types. These types implement the Interface for comparision and
swap defined in the sort package.
</p>

<p>
The <code>Reverse()</code> function returns the reverse order of data. Let’s look at an example of
sorting a slice of strings, integers, and floats in reverse order:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main

<span style="color: #F0DFAF; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #93E0E3;">main</span>() {

}

</code></pre>


<p>
Many times, you would want to sort a collection by something other than its natural order.
For example, you would want to sort a slice of strings by their length, or you would want to
sort a slice of users by their age.
</p>

<p>
For these usecases, you can use the <code>Slice()</code> and <code>SliceStable()</code> functions provided by the sort
package. These are higher order functions that accept a less function as an argument:
</p>

TL;DR; Neither. Use %w in 99.99% of cases. In the other 0.001% of cases, %v and
%s probably "should" behave the same, except when the error value is nil, but
there are no guarantees. The friendlier output of %v for nil errors may be
reason to prefer %v (see below).
