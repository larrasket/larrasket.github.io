A tutorial in concurrency and parallelism with the Go programming language.

</div>



<p>
When most people use the word “concurrent,” they’re usually referring to a
process that occurs simultaneously with one or more processes. It is also
usually implied that all of these processes are making progress at about the
same time. Under this definition, an easy way to think about this is people. You
are currently reading this sentence while others in the world are simultaneously
living their lives. They are existing <i>concurrently</i> to you.

<div id="outline-container-org600d1e9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org600d1e9">Why?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org600d1e9">
<p>
As with most paths toward understanding, we’ll begin with a bit of history. Let’s first
take a look at how concurrency became such an important topic.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org00dc837" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org00dc837">Moore&rsquo;s Law, Web, And the Current Mess</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org00dc837">
<p>
In 1965, Gordon Moore wrote a three-page paper that described both the consolidation of
the electronics market toward integrated circuits and the doubling of the number of
components in an integrated circuit every year for at least a decade. In 1975, he revised
this prediction to state that the number of components on an integrated circuit would
double every two years. This prediction more or less held until just
recently—around 2012.
</p>

<p>
Several companies foresaw this slowdown in the rate Moore’s law predicted and began to
investigate alternative ways to increase computing power. As the saying goes, necessity is
the mother of innovation, and so it was in this way that multicore processors were born.
</p>

<p>
This looked like a clever way to solve the bounding problems of Moore’s law, but computer
scientists soon found themselves facing down the limits of another law: Amdahl’s law, named
after computer architect Gene Amdahl.  Amdahl’s law describes a way in which to model the
potential performance gains from implementing the solution to a problem in a parallel
manner. Simply put, it states that the gains are bounded by how much of the program must be
written sequentially.
</p>

<p>
For example, imagine you were writing a program that was largely GUI based: a user is
presented with an interface, clicks on some buttons, and stuff happens. This type of program
is bounded by one very large sequential portion of the pipeline: human interaction. No
matter how many cores you make available to this program, it will always be bounded by how
quickly the user can interact with the interface.  Now consider a different example,
calculating the digits of pi. Thanks to a class of algorithms called spigot algorithms, this
problem is called embarrassingly parallel, which —despite sounding made up—is a technical
term that means that it can easily be divided into parallel tasks. In this case,
significant gains can be made by making more cores available to your program, and your new
problem becomes how to combine and store the results.
</p>

<p>
For problems that are embarrassingly parallel, it is recommended that you write your
application so that it can scale horizontally. This means that you can take instances of
your program, run it on more CPUs, or machines, and this will cause the runtime of
the system to improve. Embarrassingly parallel problems fit this model so well
because it’s very easy to structure your program in such a way that you can send
chunks of a problem to different instances of your application.

Concurrent code is notoriously difficult to get right. It usually takes a few iterations to
get it working as expected, and even then it’s not uncommon for bugs to exist in code for
years before some change in timing (heavier disk utilization, more users logged into the
system, etc.) causes a previously undiscovered bug to rear its head. Indeed, for this very
book, I’ve gotten as many eyes as possible on the code to try and mitigate this.

<div id="outline-container-orgd8ae198" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd8ae198">Race Conditions</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd8ae198">
<p>
A race condition occurs when two or more operations must execute in the correct order, but
the program has not been written so that this order is guaranteed to be maintained.
</p>

<p>
Most of the time, this shows up in what’s called a data race, where one concurrent operation
attempts to read a variable while at some undetermined time another concurrent operation
is attempting to write to the same variable.
</p>

<p>
Here’s a basic example:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">var</span> <span style="color: #df7fff;">data</span> <span style="color: #f470df;">int</span>
<span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">go</span> <span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">func</span>() {
&#9474;   data++
}()
<span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">if</span> data == 0 {
&#9474;   fmt.<span style="color: #f59280;">Printf</span>(<span style="color: #e5b76f;">"the value is %v.\n"</span>, data)
}
</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org2ce36ad" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2ce36ad">Atomicity</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2ce36ad">
<p>
When something is considered atomic, or has the property of atomicity, this means that
within the context that it is operating, it is indivisible, or uninterruptible.
</p>

<p>
So what does that mean, and why is this important to know when working with
concurrent code?
</p>

<p>
The first and very important thing is the word “context.” Something may be atomic in one
context, but not another. Operations that are atomic within the context of your process may
not be atomic in the context of the operating system; operations that are atomic within the
context of the operating system may not be atomic within the context of your machine, and
operations that are atomic within the context of your machine may not be atomic within the
context of your application. In other words, the atomicity of an operation can change
depending on the currently defined scope.  This fact can work both for and against you.
</p>

<p>
When thinking about atomicity, very often the first thing you need to do is to define
the context or scope, and the operation will be considered to be atomic. Everything
follows from this.
</p>

<p>
Now let’s look at the terms “indivisible” and “uninterruptible.” These terms mean that
within the context you’ve defined, something that is atomic will happen in its entirety
without anything happening in that context simultaneously. That’s still a mouthful, so let’s
look at an example:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgc4fe3f9">
i++
</pre>
<p>
This is about as simple an example as anyone can contrive, and yet it easily demonstrates
the concept of atomicity. It may look atomic, but a brief analysis reveals several
operations:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Retrieve the value of <code>i</code>.</li>
<li>Increment the value <code>o</code>.</li>
<li>Store the value of <code>i</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
While each of these operations alone is atomic, the combination of the three may not be,
depending on your context. This reveals an interesting property of atomic operations:
combining them does not necessarily produce a larger atomic operation. Making the operation
atomic is dependent on which context you’d like it to be atomic within. If your context is a
program with no concurrent processes, then this code is atomic within that context. If your
context is a goroutine that doesn’t expose I to other goroutines, then this code is atomic.

<h3 id="orgeb1c6db">Deadlocks</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgeb1c6db">
<p>
A deadlocked program is one in which all concurrent processes are waiting on one
another. In this state, the program will never recover without outside intervention.
If that sounds grim, it’s because it is! The Go runtime attempts to do its part and will
detect some deadlocks (all goroutines must be blocked, or “asleep”), but this doesn’t
do much to help you prevent deadlocks.
</p>

<p>
To help solidify what a deadlock is, let’s first look at an example.<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
There is an accepted proposal to allow the runtime to detect partial deadlocks, but

<p>
If you were to try and run this code, you’d probably see:

<pre class="example" id="org8ac6498">

<p>
Why? If you look carefully, you’ll see a timing issue in this code. Following is a graph‐
local representation of what’s going on. The boxes represent functions, the horizontal lines
calls to these functions and the vertical bars lifetimes of the function at the head of the

<p>
It seems pretty obvious why this deadlock is occurring when we lay it out graphically like
that, but we would benefit from a more rigorous definition. It turns out there are a few
conditions that must be present for deadlocks to arise, and in 1971, Edgar Coff‐ man
enumerated these conditions in a paper. The conditions are now known as the Coffman
Conditions are the basis for techniques that help detect, prevent, and correct
deadlocks.

<h2 id="y6c6tzo02wj0">Concurrency vs Parallelism</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org627c24f">
<p>
The fact that concurrency is different from parallelism is often overlooked or
misunderstood. In conversations between many developers, the two terms are often used
interchangeably to mean “something that runs at the same time as something else.”  Sometimes
using the word “parallel” in this context is correct, but usually, if the developers are
discussing code, they really ought to be using the word “concurrent.”
</p>

<p>
The reason to differentiate goes well beyond pedantry. The difference between concurrency
and parallelism turns out to be a very powerful abstraction when modeling your code, and Go
takes full advantage of this. Let’s take a look at how the two concepts are different so
that we can understand the power of this abstraction. We’ll start with a very simple
statement:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Concurrency is a property of the code; parallelism is a property of the running program.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
Don’t we usually think about these two things the same way? We write our code so that it
will execute in parallel. Right?
</p>

<p>
Well, let’s think about that for a second. If I write my code with the intent that two chunks
of the program will run in parallel, do I have any guarantee that will happen when
the program is run? What happens if I run the code on a machine with only one core? Some may
be thinking, It will run in parallel, but this isn’t true!
</p>


<p>
The chunks of our program may appear to be running in parallel, but they’re executing
sequentially faster than is distinguishable. The CPU context switches to share
time between different programs, and over a coarse enough granularity of time, the tasks
appear to be running in parallel. If we were to run the same binary on a machine with two
cores, the program’s chunks might be running in parallel.
</p>

<p>
This reveals a few interesting and important things. The first is that we do not write
parallel code, only concurrent code that we hope will be run in parallel. Once again,
parallelism is a property of the runtime of our program, not the code.
</p>

<p>
The second interesting thing is that we see it is possible—maybe even desirable—to be
ignorant of whether our concurrent code is running in parallel. This is only made
possible by the layers of abstraction that lie beneath our program’s model: the concurrency
primitives, the program’s runtime, the operating system, the platform the operating system
runs on (in the case of hypervisors, containers, and virtual machines), and ultimately the
CPUs. These abstractions are what allow us to make the distinction between concurrency and
parallelism, and ultimately what gives us the power and flexibility to express ourselves.
We’ll come back to this.

<h2 id="ddj750p02wj0">CPS</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgfb77e18">
<p>
A CSP stands for “Communicating Sequential Processes,” which is both a technique and
the name of the paper that introduced it. In 1978, Charles Antony Richard Hoare
published a paper in the Association for Computing Machinery (more popularly
referred to as ACM).
</p>

<p>
In this paper, Hoare suggests that input and output are two overlooked primitives of
programming—particularly in concurrent code. At the time Hoare authored this paper, research
was still being done on how to structure programs, but most of this effort was being
directed to techniques for sequential code: usage of the goto statement was being debated
(yeah funny history), and the object-oriented paradigm was beginning to take root.
Concurrent operations weren’t being given much thought. Hoare set out to correct this, and
thus his paper, and CSP, were born.
</p>

<p>
In the 1978 paper, CSP was only a simple programming language constructed solely to
demonstrate the power of communicating sequential processes; in fact, he even says in the
paper:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Thus the concepts and notations introduced in this paper should … not be regarded as
suitable for use as a programming language, either for abstract or concrete programming.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
Hoare was deeply concerned that the techniques he was presenting did nothing to further the
study of the correctness of programs, and that the techniques may not be performant in a real
language based on his own. Over the next six years, the idea of CSP was refined into a
formal representation of something called process calculus to take the ideas of
communicating sequential processes and beginning to reason about <i>program correctness</i>.
Process calculus is a way to mathematically model concurrent systems and also provides
algebraic laws to perform transformations on these systems to analyze their various
properties, e.g., efficiency and correctness
</p>

<p>
To support his assertion that inputs and outputs needed to be considered language
primitives, Hoare’s CSP programming language contained primitives to model input and output,
or communication, between processes correctly (this is where the paper’s name comes from).
Hoare applied the term processes to any encapsulated portion of logic that required input to
run and produced output other processes would consume. Hoare probably could have used the
word “function” were it not for the debate on how to structure programs occurring in the
community when he wrote his paper.
</p>

<p>
For communication between the processes, Hoare created input and output commands: <code>!</code> for
sending input into a process, and <code>?</code> for reading output from a process.  Each command had to
specify either an output variable (in the case of reading a variable out of a process) or
a destination (in the case of sending input to a process).  Sometimes these two would refer
to the same thing, in which case the two processes would be said to correspond. In other
words, output from one process would flow directly into the input of another process.
</p>

<p>
History has judged Hoare’s suggestion to be correct; however, it’s interesting to note that
before Go was released, few languages brought support for these primitives into
the language. Most popular languages favor sharing and synchronizing access to the memory
to CSP’s message-passing style. There are exceptions, but unfortunately, these are confined
to languages that haven’t seen wide adoption. Go is one of the first languages to
incorporate principles from CSP in its core, and bring this style of concurrent programming
to the masses. Its success has led other languages to attempt to add these primitives as
well.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org815f284" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org815f284"><code>Goroutine</code></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org815f284">
<p>
The Goroutines are one of the most basic units of organization in a Go program, so it’s
important we understand what they are and how they work. Every Go program has at
least one goroutine: the main goroutine, which is automatically created and started when the
process begins. In almost any program you’ll probably find yourself reaching for a goroutine
sooner or later to assist in solving your problems. So what are they?
</p>

<p>
Goroutines are unique to Go (though some other languages have a concurrency primitive that
is similar).  They’re not OS threads, and they’re not exactly green threads—threads that are
managed by a language’s runtime—they’re a higher level of abstraction known as coroutines.
Coroutines are simply concurrent subroutines (functions, closures, or methods in Go) that
are nonpreemptive—that is, they cannot be interrupted. Instead, coroutines have multiple
points throughout which allow for suspension or reentry.
</p>

<p>
What makes goroutines unique to Go is their deep integration with Go’s runtime.  Goroutines
don’t define their suspension or reentry points; Go’s runtime observes the runtime
behavior of goroutines and automatically suspends them when they block and then resumes them
when they become unblocked. In a way, this makes them preemptable, but only at points where
the goroutine has become blocked. It is an elegant partnership between the runtime and a
goroutine’s logic. Thus, goroutines can be considered a special class of coroutine.
</p>

<p>
Coroutines, and thus goroutines, are implicitly concurrent constructs, but concurrency is
not a property of a coroutine: something must host several coroutines simultaneously and
allow each to execute—otherwise, they wouldn’t be concurrent.
</p>

<p>
Go’s mechanism for hosting goroutines is an implementation of what’s called an M: N
scheduler, which means it maps M green threads to N OS threads. Goroutines are then
scheduled onto the green threads. When we have more goroutines than green threads available,
the scheduler handles the distribution of the goroutines across the available threads and
ensures that when these goroutines become blocked, other goroutines can be run.
</p>

<p>
The go statement is how Go performs a fork, and the forked threads of execution are
goroutines. Let’s return to our simple goroutine example:
</p>
<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #df7fff;">sayHello</span> := <span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">func</span>() {
fmt.<span style="color: #f59280;">Println</span>(<span style="color: #e5b76f;">"hello"</span>)
}
<span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">go</span> <span style="color: #f59280;">sayHello</span>()
</code></pre>

<p>
Here, the <code>sayHello</code> function will be run on its goroutine, while the rest of the
program continues executing. In this example, there is no join point. The goroutine
executing <code>sayHello</code> will simply exit at some undetermined time in the future, and the rest
of the program will have already continued executing.
</p>

<p>
There is one problem with this example: as written, it’s undetermined whether the <code>sayHello</code>
the function will ever be run at all. The goroutine will be created and scheduled with Go’s
runtime to execute, but it may not get a chance to run before the main goroutine
exits.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, because we omit the rest of the main function for simplicity, when we
run this small example, it is almost certain that the program will finish executing before
the goroutine hosting the call to <code>sayHello</code> is ever started. As a result, you won’t see the
word “hello” printed to <code>stdout</code>. You could put a <code>time.Sleep</code> after you create the goroutine,
but recall that this doesn’t actually create a join point, only a race condition.
</p>

<p>
To a create a join point, you have to synchronize the main goroutine and the
sayHello goroutine. This can be done in a number of ways.

<code>WaitGroup</code> is a great way to wait for a set of concurrent operations to complete when you

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1e69fcb">
<p>
Mutex stands for “mutual exclusion” and is a way to guard critical sections of your program.
A critical section is an area of your program that requires exclusive access to a shared
resource. A Mutex provides a concurrent-safe way to express exclusive access to these shared
resources. To borrow a Goism, whereas channels share memory by communicating, a Mutex shares
memory by creating a convention developer must follow to synchronize access to the memory.
You are responsible for coordinating access to this memory by guarding access to it with a
mutex. Here’s a simple example of two goroutines that are attempting to increment and
decrement a common value; they use a Mutex to synchronize:

<p>
Critical sections are so named because they reflect a bottleneck in your program. It is
somewhat expensive to enter and exit a critical section, and so generally people attempt to
minimize the time spent in critical sections.  One strategy for doing so is to reduce the
cross-section of the critical section. There may be a memory that needs to be shared between
multiple concurrent processes, but perhaps not all of these processes will read and write to
this memory. If this is the case, you can take advantage of a different type of mutex:
<code>sync.RWMutex</code>.  The <code>sync.RWMutex</code> is conceptually the same thing as a Mutex: it guards
memory access; however, <code>RWMutex</code> gives you a little bit more control over the memory.

<div id="outline-container-org7e7a9d3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7e7a9d3"><code>Cond</code></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7e7a9d3">
<p>
The comment for the <code>Cond</code> type does a great job of describing its purpose:
</p>
<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026;a rendezvous point for goroutines waiting for or announcing the occurrence of an event.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
In that definition, an “event” is any arbitrary signal between two or more goroutines that
carries no information other than the fact that it has occurred. Very often you’ll want to
wait for one of these signals before continuing execution on a goroutine. If we were to look
at how to accomplish this without the Cond type, one naive approach is to use an infinite
loop:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgdc31893">
for conditionTrue() == false {
}
</pre>

<p>
However, this would consume all cycles of one core. To fix that, we could introduce a
<code>time.sleep</code>
</p>
<pre class="example" id="orgf3d3a95">
time.Sleep:
for conditionTrue() == false {
    time.Sleep(1*time.Millisecond)
}
</pre>

<p>
This is better, but it’s still inefficient, and you have to figure out how long to sleep
for: too long, and you’re artificially degrading performance; too short, and you’re
unnecessarily consuming too much CPU time.  It would be better if there were some kind of
a way for a goroutine to efficiently sleep until it was signaled to wake and check its
condition.  This is exactly what the Cond type does for us. Using a Cond, we could write the
example like:
</p>
<pre class="example" id="org7cbff99">
c := sync.NewCond(&amp;sync.Mutex{})
c.L.Lock()
for conditionTrue() == false {
    c.Wait()
}
c.L.Unlock()
</pre>

<p>
Let’s expand on this example and show both sides of the equation: a goroutine that is
waiting for a signal, and a goroutine that is sending signals. Say we have a queue of fixed
length 2, and 10 items we want to push onto the queue. We want to enqueue items as soon as
there is room, so we want to be notified as soon as there’s room in the queue. Let’s try
using a Cond to manage this coordination:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #df7fff;">c</span> := sync.<span style="color: #f59280;">NewCond</span>(&amp;<span style="color: #f470df;">sync.Mutex</span>{})
<span style="color: #df7fff;">queue</span> := <span style="color: #a897ef; font-weight: bold;">make</span>([]<span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">interface</span>{}, 0, 10)
<span style="color: #df7fff;">removeFromQueue</span> := <span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">func</span>(<span style="color: #df7fff;">delay</span> <span style="color: #f470df;">time.Duration</span>) {
&#9474;   time.<span style="color: #f59280;">Sleep</span>(delay)
&#9474;   c.L.<span style="color: #f59280;">Lock</span>()
&#9474;   queue = queue[1:]
&#9474;   fmt.<span style="color: #f59280;">Println</span>(<span style="color: #e5b76f;">"Removed from queue"</span>)
&#9474;   c.L.<span style="color: #f59280;">Unlock</span>()
&#9474;   c.<span style="color: #f59280;">Signal</span>()
}
<span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">for</span> <span style="color: #df7fff;">i</span> := 0; i &lt; 10; i++{
&#9474;   c.L.<span style="color: #f59280;">Lock</span>()
&#9474;   <span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">for</span> <span style="color: #a897ef; font-weight: bold;">len</span>(queue) == 2 {
&#9474;   &#9474;   c.<span style="color: #f59280;">Wait</span>()
&#9474;   }
&#9474;   fmt.<span style="color: #f59280;">Println</span>(<span style="color: #e5b76f;">"Adding to queue"</span>)
&#9474;   queue = <span style="color: #a897ef; font-weight: bold;">append</span>(queue, <span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">struct</span>{}{})
&#9474;   <span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">go</span> <span style="color: #f59280;">removeFromQueue</span>(1*time.Second)
&#9474;   c.L.<span style="color: #f59280;">Unlock</span>()
}
</code></pre>

<p>
We also have a new method in this example, Signal. This is one of two methods that the Cond
type provides for notifying goroutines blocked on a Wait call that the condition has been
triggered. The other is a method called Broadcast. Internally, the run-time maintains a
FIFO list of goroutines waiting to be signaled; Signal finds the goroutine that’s been
waiting for the longest and notifies that, whereas Broadcast sends a signal to all goroutines
that are waiting. Broadcast is arguably the more interesting of the two methods as it
provides a way to communicate with multiple goroutines at once.

Once is an object that will perform exactly one action.  Sounds simple enough, what’s so
useful about it then?
</p>

<p>
Well for some reason this isn’t particularly well documented, but a <code>sync.Once</code> will wait
until the execution of <code>.Do</code> completes. This makes it incredibly useful when performing
relatively expensive operations that you would typically cache in a map.

</code></pre>

<p>
That’s good and all but the code’s readability has taken a hit. It’s not immediately clear
what’s going on with <code>cached.wait</code> and the flow of operations under different situations is
not very intuitive.
</p>


<p>
Let&rsquo;s try again with <code>sync.Once</code>:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">package</span> main

&#9474;   &#9474;   }

<p>
That’s it. This achieves the same as the previous example, but is now much easier to
understand (at least in my opinion). There is only a single return, and the code flows
intuitively from top to bottom without having to read and understand what’s going on with
the <code>entry.wait</code> channel as before.

<h2 id="03ogh2p02wj0">Concurrency Patterns in Go</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf6d6487">
<p>
We’ve explored the fundamentals of Go’s concurrency primitives and discussed how to properly
use these primitives. In this chapter, we’ll do a deep-dive into how to compose these
primitives into patterns that will help keep your system scalable and maintainable.
</p>

<p>
However, before we get started, we need to touch upon the format of some of the pat‐ terns
contained in this chapter. In a lot of the examples, we’ll be using channels that pass empty
interfaces (interface{}) around.

<h3 id="org5c40252">Confinement</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5c40252">
<p>
When working with concurrent code, there are a few different options for safe operation.
We’ve gone over two of them:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Synchronization primitives for sharing memory (e.g., <code>sync.Mutex</code>)</li>
<li>Synchronization via communicating (e.g., <code>channels</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, there are a couple of other options that are implicitly safe within multiple
concurrent processes:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Immutable data</li>
<li>Data protected by confinement</li>
</ul>

<p>
In some sense, immutable data is ideal because it is implicitly concurrent-safe. Each
concurrent process may operate on the same data, but it may not modify it. If it wants to
create new data, it must create a new copy of the data with the desired modifications. This
allows not only a lighter cognitive load on the developer but can also lead to faster
programs if it leads to smaller critical sections (or eliminates them altogether). In Go,
you can achieve this by writing code that utilizes copies of values instead of pointers to
values in memory.
</p>

<p>
Confinement is the simple yet powerful idea of ensuring information is only ever available
from one concurrent process. When this is achieved, a concurrent program is implicitly safe
and no synchronization is needed. There are two kinds of confinement possible: ad hoc and
lexical.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org4f909fd" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4f909fd">Ad Hoc</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4f909fd">
<p>
Ad hoc confinement is when you achieve confinement through a convention whether it be set by
the languages community, the group you work within, or the code-base you work within. In my
opinion, sticking to convention is difficult to achieve on projects of any size unless you
have tools to perform static analysis on your code every time someone commits some code.
Here’s an example of ad hoc confinement that demonstrates why:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">import</span> <span style="color: #e5b76f;">"fmt"</span>
<span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #f59280;">main</span>() {

&#9474;   &#9474;   <span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">defer</span> <span style="color: #a897ef; font-weight: bold;">close</span>(handleData)
&#9474;   &#9474;   <span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">for</span> <span style="color: #df7fff;">i</span> := <span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">range</span> data {
&#9474;   &#9474;   &#9474;   handleData &lt;- data[i]
&#9474;   &#9474;   }
&#9474;   }
&#9474;   <span style="color: #df7fff;">handleData</span> := <span style="color: #a897ef; font-weight: bold;">make</span>(<span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">chan</span> <span style="color: #f470df;">int</span>)

&#9474;   &#9474;   fmt.<span style="color: #f59280;">Println</span>(num)
&#9474;   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>
We can see that the data slice of integers is available from both the loopData function and
the loop over the handleData channel; however, by convention we’re only accessing it from
the loopData function.

<p>
 Why pursue confinement if we have synchronization available to us? The answer is improved
performance and reduced cognitive load on developers.  Synchronization comes with a cost,
and if you can avoid it you won’t have any critical sections, and therefore you won’t have
to pay the cost of synchronizing them.<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

<h3 id="orge7f5801">Preventing Goroutine Leaks</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge7f5801">
<p>
When you are dealing with a memory leak in Go, there is a possability by 99% that your
dealing with goroutines leak.
</p>


<p>
The goroutine has a few paths to termination:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When it has completed its work.</li>
<li>When it cannot continue its work due to an unrecoverable error.</li>
<li>When it’s told to stop working.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We get the first two paths for free—these paths are your algorithm—but what about work
cancellation? This turns out to be the most important bit because of the network effect: if
you’ve begun a goroutine, it’s most likely cooperating with several other goroutines in some
sort of organized fashion. We could even represent this interconnectedness as a graph:
whether or not a child goroutine should continue executing might be predicated on knowledge
of the state of many other goroutines. The parent
</p>


<p>
goroutine (often the main goroutine) with this full contextual knowledge should be able to
tell its child goroutines to terminate. Let’s start with a simple exam ple of a goroutine
leak:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #f59280;">main</span>() {
&#9474;   <span style="color: #df7fff;">doWork</span> := <span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">func</span>(<span style="color: #df7fff;">strings</span> &lt;-<span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">chan</span> <span style="color: #f470df;">string</span>) &lt;-<span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">chan</span> <span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">interface</span>{} {

&#9474;   &#9474;   <span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">go</span> <span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">func</span>() {

&#9474;   &#9474;   &#9474;   <span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">for</span> <span style="color: #df7fff;">s</span> := <span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">range</span> strings {
&#9474;   &#9474;   &#9474;   &#9474;   <span style="color: #bf9f8f; font-style: italic;">// </span><span style="color: #bf9f8f; font-style: italic;">Do something interesting</span>

&#9474;   &#9474;   &#9474;   }
&#9474;   &#9474;   }()
&#9474;   &#9474;   <span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">return</span> completed
&#9474;   }
&#9474;   <span style="color: #f59280;">doWork</span>(<span style="color: #ff78aa;">nil</span>)
&#9474;   <span style="color: #bf9f8f; font-style: italic;">// </span><span style="color: #bf9f8f; font-style: italic;">Perhaps more work is done here</span>

&#9474;   fmt.<span style="color: #f59280;">Println</span>(runtime.<span style="color: #f59280;">NumGoroutine</span>())
}
</code></pre>

<p>
Here we see that the main goroutine passes a nil channel into doWork. Therefore, the strings
channel will never actually gets any strings written onto it, and the goroutine containing
doWork will remain in memory for the lifetime of this process (we would even deadlock if we
joined the goroutine within doWork and the main goroutine).
</p>

<p>
In this example, the lifetime of the process is very short, but in a real program,
goroutines could easily be started at the beginning of a long-lived program. In the worst
case, the main goroutine could continue to spin up goroutines throughout its life, causing
creep in memory utilization.
</p>


<p>
The way to successfully mitigate this is to establish a signal between the parent goroutine
and its children that allows the parent to signal cancellation to its children. By
convention, this signal is usually a read-only channel named done. The parent goroutine
passes this channel to the child goroutine and then closes the channel when it wants to
cancel the child goroutine. Here’s an example:
</p>

<pre class="code"><code><span style="color: #ef80bf; font-weight: bold;">func</span> <span style="color: #f59280;">main</span>() {
