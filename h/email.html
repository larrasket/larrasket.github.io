You don&rsquo;t need to be so polite, I follow Crocker&rsquo;s rules<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Declaring yourself to be operating by &ldquo;Crocker&rsquo;s Rules&rdquo; means that other
people are allowed to optimize their messages for information, not for being
nice to you.  Crocker&rsquo;s Rules means that you have accepted full responsibility
for the operation of your own mind - if you&rsquo;re offended, it&rsquo;s your fault.
Anyone is allowed to call you a moron and claim to be doing you a favor.
(Which, in point of fact, they would be.  One of the big problems with this
culture is that everyone&rsquo;s afraid to tell you you&rsquo;re wrong, or they think they
have to dance around it.)  Two people using Crocker&rsquo;s Rules should be able to
communicate all relevant information in the minimum amount of time, without
paraphrasing or social formatting.  Obviously, don&rsquo;t declare yourself to be
operating by Crocker&rsquo;s Rules unless you have that kind of mental discipline.
</span> I appreciate your
politeness but I prefer if you just optimize your messages for information, not
being nice to me. I will always be polite to you and following Crocker&rsquo;s rules
doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m gonna be rude, it just mean that I don&rsquo;t get offended easily,
certainly not by you giving me most information and less time-taking useless
words.
</p>

<p>
Don&rsquo;t be shy to ask me a for a favor, if you need anything and feel I can do it
for you, ask me. I&rsquo;ll say no if I can&rsquo;t do it or I just don&rsquo;t want to.
