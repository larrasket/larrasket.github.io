I wrote on <a href="../d/languages.html#jb9efrq00xj0">The Prefect Programming Language</a> my thoughts about what would be the
prefect language out there, and what would be the nearest thing of it. It&rsquo;s C
and this is not going to change (any far at least), however, perfect is not
always practical. I still believe in Lisp-like syntax superiority and I love the
flexibility of dynamic typing and dynamic loading, and C has both already. Still
C lacks many things like a proper build system (that convince everybody) and
packaging.
</p>

<p>
From the list on that article, I&rsquo;d be left with Julia and <a href="../cs/go.html#lvkhzyo02wj0">Go</a>, Julia has two
downsides of the <a href="../d/languages.html#uau7ou11qxj0">Centralized Package Repository</a> and the use of <a href="../d/languages.html#x0z0fu11qxj0">Exception
handling</a>. And Go has the downside of not having a REPL. For me, when it comes to
the real world, the issue with centralization does not matter more than the
issue of getting the work done (i.e. REPL weights more).
</p>

<p>
Going more practically from there, I see a high potential with Clojure, it
does not have the OOP trash like Common Lisp and it is a Lisp, it is not too new
like Jack, and it can interlope with Java. Perhaps it&rsquo;s the go-to language for
me right now. Displacing Common Lisp.

I am considering reading Don Quixote. But I&rsquo;m still unsure. I think there are
so many books that are propagated around and everywhere merely because of
pseudointellectuality. War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy was one of those novels
that I had a similar experience with. It&rsquo;s one of the most unreadable novels
in my opinion, however, it&rsquo;s always considered either #1 or #2 best works by people who
post book ratings on <a href="Mar2023-May2023.html#1g48iao02wj0">book communites</a>. After I read it back then, due to the
severe amount of recommendation, I was surprised that it&rsquo;s hardly a plain, and
very long, novel, I tried to find later someone to discuss my view with him
about the novel, I could only find people majored in literature who can discuss
it, but theoretically only, and I found out that most of the people who
recommenced it to me never actually read it.

I like thinking about names, they usually reflect people&rsquo;s dreams and values,
many times I feel devastated when contemplating names, like when find a
convicted thief named Ali I usually think that their parents did find great
values in the historical character of Imam Ali that they wished to recall in
their child, and how sad it went. I personally believe that names have a great
effect on us. Which is not debatable [from a theory-of-complexity perspective].
But how can they shape our personalities? A study once showed that boys who are
given names more common among girls are more likely to develop behavioral
problems when they reach puberty,<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">David Figlio, <i>Boys Named Sue: Disruptive Children and Their Peers</i> (National Bureau of Economic Research, 2005), <a href="https://doi.org/10.3386/w11277">https://doi.org/10.3386/w11277</a>.</span> but the
reason behind that itself is very obvious (likely to be). What about their
effect on our innersole? I think there should be. The priming effect is one that
proves it, however, it&rsquo;s very controversial, but let me tell you about it.
</p>

<p>
Priming is the idea that exposure to one stimulus may influence a response to a
subsequent stimulus, without conscious guidance or intention. The stimulus
itself can be a subliminal stimuli, for example, if someone were to read you an
article about people in a retirement home, your subconscious recalls old people,
who walk very slow, the Priming theorists believe that this might actually cause
you to walk slightly slower as result of your subconscious thinking. And if you
were to experience the same thing but with talking about top football players,
you might walk faster. Interesting theory no? Unfortunately it has great
problems in documenting the experiments.<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Bruce Bower, “The Hot and Cold of Priming: Psychologists Are Divided on Whether Unnoticed Cues Can Influence Behavior,” <i>Science News</i> 181, no. 10 (May 2012): 26–29, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/scin.5591811025">https://doi.org/10.1002/scin.5591811025</a>.</span>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve a simple take on marriage and relationships that does not involve my
radical thoughts about family, I think it should very obvious, but I find myself
have to point it out in many discussions. And it&rsquo;s basically about the struggle
that occurs because of class differential between couples, it can be reduced to
a simple imbalance or dependency issue.
</p>

<p>
My view derives from the historical nature of the relationship between men and
women. Historically speaking, there&rsquo;s a very interesting fact in the very maiden
year of human slavery, that&rsquo;s, female slavery appeared earlier that
male&rsquo;s.<label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Gerda Lerner, “Women and Slavery,” <i>Slavery &#38;Amp; Abolition</i> 4, no. 3 (December 1983): 173–98, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/01440398308574858">https://doi.org/10.1080/01440398308574858</a>.</span> To understand the significance of that let us
understand why slavery ever appeared; slavery is something that is as new as
civilization to the H. sapiens, actually slavery only dates back to 3500
BC,<label for="4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Elisabeth Meier Tetlow, <i>Sumer</i>, vol. 1, Women, Crime, and Punishment in Ancient Law and Society (New York: A&#38;C Black, 2004).</span> most anthropologists explain this emergence as
related to the new production techniques that were adopted and led eventually to
a the first class division known in history. The interesting thing here is that,
this division happened earlier to females, they were enslaved but not only by
higher class but by an opposite (equal) gender. This happened because the new
intensive production techniques tended to prioritize men’s labour over women’s
for the first time which was not the case at all: women used to be as productive
and their <i>labour</i> was as much important as men&rsquo;s in the pre-horticulture
era.<label for="5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">Ernestine Friedl, <i>Women and Men: An Anthropologist’s View</i> (Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1975), 28.</span> What is to be learnt from this historical
fact? Well, basically the more differences in power between parties the more
pulverization is likely to occur.  Consequently, when you apply this to
modern-relationships decisions you will find that many people did not learn this
basic lesson of history yet.

<p>
Goodness and malignity. At first men imposed their own personalities on Nature:
everywhere they saw themselves and their like, i.e. their own evil and
capricious temperaments, hidden, as it were, behind clouds, thunder-storms, wild
beasts, trees, and plants: it was then that they declared Nature was evil.
Afterwards there came a time, that of Rousseau, when they sought to distinguish
themselves from Nature: they were so tired of each other that they wished to
have separate little hiding-places where man and his misery could not penetrate:
then they invented “nature is good.”

I think I&rsquo;ve a nice tip on that, although it might sounds very naive, it really
helped me personally. I think that the reason behind post-achievement depression
is that we forget why we wanted whatever we achieved or that we no longer
possess the same perspectives that made us want that thing, the reason behind
that is usually the long period that is dedicated on achieving it, in which you
are likely to change more. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s most common in academia especially
with people getting their Ph.D after 5 years of work or even more. So basically
we forget why we want something and how we felt towards wanting it (think of it
like someone working 2 years to earn an Ijazah believing it to be a great
achievement, but they turn atheist in the second year). So my tip is basically a
usage of intensive imagination in a different stages of what we want.
</p>

<p>
And this does not have to be a protection from depression to be honest, but it
</p>

<p>
can be used as a refreshing method to really understand our passions and what we
&ldquo;really&rdquo; want (not what we ought to by collective consciousness or propaganda):
think of yourself getting it and estimate your happiness or satisfaction.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2025-04-12 Sat 18:40]</span></span> As of now, I&rsquo;m not really sure if this method will work
properly for most people, as most of us generate these delusional views about
how things are going to be like after the achievement. See also: <a href="../p/depression.html#yh144x4121k0">On Depression</a>.</li>

It&rsquo;s always recommended to check what your vendors/origins provide before
looking for third-party solution. I learnt that the hard way years ago when I
was in the Digital Signal Processing class and trying to take math notes, I was
new to Org-mode and the Emacs rabbit whole that time and I wanted to use
Org-mode for this mission. I came across <a href="https://gitlab.com/matsievskiysv/math-preview">this</a> program from reddit, it&rsquo;s called
&ldquo;math-preview&rdquo;, I thought that this was the utility I need to write LaTeX
equations inside Org. I spent hours trying to install it (npm tragedy), and even
after getting it to work, I was getting Elisp errors inside Emacs. I do not
remember how it ended though, perhaps someone told me that Emacs does what I
wanted out of the box? Anyway. It&rsquo;s only a fun memory now <code>:)</code>
