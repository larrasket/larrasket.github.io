For some reason the media refuse to show people any content that could be
considered as &rsquo;violent&rsquo; accordingly to their policies<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

</span>. You never see
someone gets crucial physical hurt in media. Never. I believe this has a
critical bad effect on people who are not instituting a view of the world out of
what they are being indoctrinated in the media, and this false view of the world
(that&rsquo;s free of unthinkable incidents) tends to make them blunder badly in such
situations. I&rsquo;ve personally seen some of the examples of the accidents that
media won&rsquo;t cover, both IRL and on some obscure websites; in both I&rsquo;ve noticed
that most people are being shocked and freezed rather than leery and careful.
They freeze in surprise instead of trying to move quickly, take action and save
what could be saved. Being shocked in such a situation shouldn&rsquo;t be strange,
however getting hysterically freezed is. The reason of this common freeze is the
fragile state of mind of these people that media have instituted (review Liquid
Modernity for further reading on this point), they never imagined or even
thought of such a thing to happen in their view of the world; this deep shock
which is reflected in their freeze is a manifestation of the collapse of their
awareness.

<a href="http://www.chesstree.net/">Chess opening explorer and repertoire builder</a>.  An idea that I&rsquo;ve got to believe
in recently, is the fact that our lives are not impacted by anything more than
our own choices. This would either sound very trivial or inaccurate for some of
you. The ones who would think of it as a trivial assertion probably have not
considered the possibility of being stuck at uncontrollable circumstances, like
being killed by an earthquake or whatever; your choices have noth there is a lot
of subjectivity when it comes to telling what is uncontrollable to us; for
example, one could have made the choice to ensure his invulnerability against
such a disaster. I&rsquo;ve been disagreed with a lot when it comes to choices, people
always mention &rsquo;feasibilities&rsquo;, but I think of it as extra choices to be put
right, which indeed adds more &rsquo;complexity&rsquo; when we see it in our view; however
when you look at it more abstractively; it&rsquo;s nothing but a tree of choices, just
like the one in the linked tree.<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Going off of from these cutting edges, the &rsquo;peak of choices&rsquo; applies to our
lives (these which for the most don&rsquo;t get affected by uncontrollable sequnces)
as a matter of fact. Are you going to spend the next couple of hours watching
useless dopamine dumps on Youtube or browising some hard science papers raising
p your knowledge, purity and sublimity? It&rsquo;s your choice.

I find the &rsquo;books community&rsquo; (wherever it is, goodreads or some social network
groups) to be one of the most asinine and silly ideas I have ever seen. Books
are about ideas, not about books themselves. Who do you think
might be responsible for that reducing of books into mere objects fixated upon
themselves rather than their profound ideas? Those who were too indolent
to comprehend the rudimentary fundamentals of them. &ldquo;books did not
work for me,&rdquo; says some dropout from a preparatory school or whatever, they saw
books merely as inanimate objects that contained some inconsequential material.
This is the essence of the term &rsquo;bookworm,&rsquo; a decent description by an
individual who was unable to grasp someone else&rsquo;s discipline (some philosophical
idea, mathematical branch, physic, or anything) that happened to be written in a
collection of papers (book) and, therefore, reduced it to a level they could
comprehend - that being books, not ideas on them. The reasons underlying the
formation of these communities are purely pseudointellectuality. Books are not about
books. It is the ideas contained therein that possess significance, not the
books themselves. If those ideas were introduced somewhere else that have more
features than the print text format, no one would read books.

Days and events hold no inherent specialty, for they are but mere markers of
time. Their occurrence brings no inherent alteration, nor do they impact any
change. On the morrow, Ramadan shall commence and, as is the custom, many shall
choose to amend their ways. Some will stop listening to music, others shall stop
mistreating themselves, and the like. Though I find the overall notion
commendable, the idea of it being a limited-time resolution does not sit well
with me. I have encountered those who abstain from music only during Ramadan,
and this perplexes me. They either normalize their misdeeds in their
subconscious or are foolish enough to believe that their actions during Ramadan
are different from the rest of the year. I suspect it to be the former, for it
is a curious thought that they accept their wrongdoing as acceptable for most of
the year but not during Ramadan. Do they desist from theft and other unethical
behavior solely during Ramadan? This is questionable. If you believe that
certain things are bad, why you are not trying to apply yourself to them?
Especially that it&rsquo;s pretty possible through 30 days, or you are not looking for
virtues out of resolutions?
