A startup or the like would be vastly interested in having a name that is easy
to remember and not necessarily expressive, such as viber, YouTube, Google,
etc., which is understandable, what I can never understand why would a software
library do so? Why having a library named <a href="https://github.com/ProtonMail/gluon">glun</a> or <a href="https://github.com/maxpert/marmot">marmot</a>, can you guess which
one of these is the IMAP server and which is distributed SQLite replicator? This
does not make any sense. Imagine if you are talking with your team about a
workflow that involves a set of these application &ldquo;the server runs <a href="https://github.com/olivia-ai/olivia">oliva</a> which
uses <a href="https://github.com/abusomani/go-palette">palette</a> to make the <a href="https://github.com/cenkalti/rain">rain</a> interface looks better&rdquo;, a segment of my poor
brain processing power would be already RIP processing what these strange words
are supposed to mean before actually start thinking about the main statement. I
believe that the domination of this type of naming (random names of mascots or
anime girls) is relatively new, most old software had either a very meaningful
name (cat-concatenation) or at least a name to which you can link (PostgreSQL).
Now an assignment for you, try to guess what does the software named <a href="https://github.com/posativ/isso">isso</a> do?
Please always give your software/library a meaningful name. Stop using anime
girls names for naming utilities.

Those men who are in themselves destinies, and whose advent is the advent of
fate, the whole race of heroic bearers of burdens: oh! how heartily and gladly
would they have respite from themselves for once in a while!—how they crave
after stout hearts and shoulders, that they might free themselves, were it but
for an hour or two, from that which oppresses them! And how fruitlessly they
crave! &#x2026; They wait; they observe all that passes before their eyes: no man
even cometh nigh to them with a thousandth part of their suffering and passion,
no man guesseth to what end they have waited&#x2026;. At last, at last, they learn
the first lesson of their life: to wait no longer; and forthwith they learn
their second lesson: to be affable, to be modest; and from that time onwards to
endure everybody and every kind of thing—in short, to endure still a little more
than they had endured theretofore.

<p>
People usually misunderstand the boundaries of computing i.e. what a computer is
actually capable of. Due to the mediocre state of software industry that
reinforces computing illiteracy, this is not going to change any soon.
</p>

<p>
An example of this is ad-blocking, some people won&rsquo;t bother checking whether it
is possible to purge annoying ads from their experience, they just accept it as
the way it works. This is true for other aspects too, there was a reason why
people were surprised by the LLM thing.
</p>

<p>
IMHO this is the main reason why federated social networks such as Pleroma and
Mastodon will never become a thing, because it&rsquo;s too complicated for normies to
understand that such a thing is even possible. They already have their own
understanding of how computing should be done.

<b>Wisdom</b>. Banal wisdom: it is to know what is good. This is all about wisdom.
Now, this is mostly being reproduced using other layers of comprehension which
is understandable for people who like to delve into what is wisdom to analysis
more complicated situations in which a kind of wisdom is involved. However, for
most people and most situations of life, you will never need more than this
basic definition, understand and know what is good and do it, and prevent
yourself from falling for anything that is not good, the activities we perform
in our lives aren&rsquo;t complicated at all to tell how good they are, just track
them somehow, see how your day is being consumed, and keep only the good parts.

وأحب هنا أن أُبين معان الحكمة بإبراز ضدها، الذي قد يشار إليه بالجهالة أو الغباء،
ولكنه الظُلم. قال الراغب الأصفهاني في مفردات ألفاظ القرآن أن الظلم هو وضع الشيء
في غير موضعه المختص به. والأرض المظلومة عند العرب هي الأرض الذي لم يكن لها أن
تُحفر وحُفرت. وقال الله ولا تدع من دون الله ما لا ينفعك ولا يضرك فإن فعلت فإنك
إذًا من الظالمين. وقال إن الله لا يظلم الناس شيئًا ولكن الناس أنفسهم يظلمون. وكما
تحدثت قَبْلاً عن الاختيار والقرار <a href="May2023.html#choice">وكيف أننا لسنا سوى عاقِبَة اختياراتنا</a>، فنحن إذًا
نتاج تطبيقنا للحكمة (وفهمها، إذا كانت الاختيارات تتطلب كمًا من التحليل نحتاج
عنده قدرًا من الحكمة كما ذكرت). ولا يقدر أحد أن يضرك مثلما قد تضر نفسك، أو أن
يظلمك كما قد تظلم نفسك. ولا يُحسن أحد إليك كما قد تحسن أنت لنفسك.

من الرذائل، فالشجاعة عنده هي حل وسط بين الجُبن والتهور، والاعتدال حل وسط بين
الشراهة والتقشف، والكرم هو حل وسط بين الجشع والإفراط، الخ. فإن طريقة الحل
الوسط (الحكمة) تؤسس أخلاقًا للاعتدال.</li>

<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/">ScienceDirect.om</a> have some nice pages called &ldquo;overview&rdquo; that are created &ldquo;using

I don&rsquo;t use web history. I think it is one of the worst features that were
included in the new standards of web browsers. When web history was a thing for
the first time it was a little bit useful since there were no search engines to
use, so you would either memorize the URLs that you are using or retrieving them
from the history. Now it&rsquo;s only included as a pretext for proprietary browsers
to spy on you. However, I still believe it is a very bad idea to keep browsing
history even if you compile your browser by yourself. Imagine keeping a camera
on your &rsquo;safe&rsquo; room that records private shots of you, but it&rsquo;s totally safe
since your room is very safe place so none will be able to gain access to it.
This seems fine but why even bother guarding such a thing that is even not that
useful, but could be very dangerous too if someone seizes? This is the same way
I treat (or used to treat) browsing history.
</p>

<p>
Recently I was reading the <a href="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/">nyxt</a> browser specifications and found out that they
are using tree-style-like history instead of linear history that other browsers
use. I decided to give it a try (the tree history not nyxt, it&rsquo;s a RIP already
to me) to see how can it be useful. I noticed that I&rsquo;m being a little more
productive because I tend to browse less of shitty web content when I know that
my history is recorded, perhaps thinking that someone will review my history and
judge me :). I will update here later to inform you, dear readers, whether it
does worth keeping this dangerous thing in your machine.
