It piques my curiosity the vicissitude that happened in some era of softwar e
history, that one that converted user from an intelligent adventurer that we
have to consider their understanding, give them warnings and provide them with
helpful logs; into a really stupid creature that live without a mind, and we
have to restrict, control, sell our software to, we have to hide error messages
and popup a stupid so-called friendly &ldquo;oh no, something went wrong, we are so
sorry for that!&rdquo;. This is degeneracy, users should be able to understand the
software they are using, this is the only reliable way to make the best of it.
The reason why I don&rsquo;t understand the current situation of software industry is
we already have been through it. Autocad, Interleaf, and Emacs, Matlab, LabVIEW,
mathematica, and GNU Emacs; all of these are ones of the most successful
software that ever made, all of them provided programming language interface to
configure and develop upon the software, and it&rsquo;s just incredibly useful Emacs
users and AutoLisp engineers will understand this more than anyone else, it was
really the acme of software.

Okay I&rsquo;ve to add context if you just read the previous entry (12 Feb 2023). So
yeah, basically I worked on scrapping CSS from various places and mixing them to
produce the most elegant blog you have ever seen, yeah it worked well and it was
&ldquo;fancy&rdquo;. But you know what? CSS is a bloat, welcome to my new world area. Now
I&rsquo;m finally satisfied.

New look, what do you think? I realized recently how not doing a CSS web project
when I was twelve had ruined or radically changed how my methods of using
computers, I believe that it was in a better way, however I&rsquo;m really curious to
know about that Saleh who would be able to write some creative css, who wouldn&rsquo;t
alienate from visual development because he can&rsquo;t stand writing CSS in XML.
Obviously I didn&rsquo;t write the css this time but used an inventive mix between my
old style and simtemapping with something I&rsquo;ve found on the internet. While I
was doing this, I really wished if I had considered it thoroughly when I decided
to migrate from hugo to emacs. Lisp is a great language to get your hands dirty
with, but like mostly every language out there it requires some amount of
periodic usage to keep your acme in writing master programs.

I love the ability of teleportation with our future-selves (maybe a one-way teleportation
would be more precise); I used to do this since an early age when I was thinking If I&rsquo;d be
able to reach the light switch the next age, actually I remember when I did and I recall
when I remembered that I would remember; time goes these timeline-challenges changed; I was
wondering if some day I&rsquo;d be able to read faster, talk in a different language, if I would
memorize the whole Quran sooner; being able to solve math and logic problem more easily;
even at the more recency, in school, I was thinking if I will solve problems faster: I had a
list of codeforces problems that I collected when I was at my first-year, the hardest of
them didn&rsquo;t take more than 3 minutes to comprehend it which would take &gt; 40 for the old me.
No new year resolution; but I&rsquo;d leave some messages to the future me that I wonder if you
will satisfy my expectation for the coming age.

It is likely impossible to build a precise argument on something that is not &rsquo;clear&rsquo;, for
example you can not criticize Shiite Islam enigmatically, that most of the factions would
deny aspects of your critique to be correlated to it. One of the &rsquo;dogmas&rsquo; (&rsquo;styles&rsquo; might be
a better synonym) that I like its clarity occurs on some teenagers so-called anti-natalism.
I do have some respect for some antinatalists such as David Benatar (the most noticeable one
indeed), and that&rsquo;s more about hi is being well put which makes him criticizable (as a
result of being subjected to the basic logic fundamentals) rather than me agreeing to his
ideology. In the other hand; I see many &rsquo;arguments&rsquo; about being antinatalists due to <i>the
lack of enjoyment</i> of having a family, tokophobia (fear of pregnancy, probably due to
misinformation) from women, gamophobia/fear of responsibility from men, and concerns about
the sexual experience for the postpartum from the both sides. Those are very clear argument
if you ask me, and in my opinion; they are mostly right, having kids, raise them to the
highest possible precious values, sacrifice your own happiness for theirs. Until you learn
to enjoy and desire the right values, such things won&rsquo;t ever be fun.

Let&rsquo;s talk about confidentiality and privacy; things that don&rsquo;t really exist <i>or</i> understood
by most people in a slippy way. Confidentiality; you are either the only one who knows it,
or it is not a secret anymore, shared secedes are worst than shared memory in a
multi-threading system. Henri de Régnier put it in an exceptional frame once: <i>There is no
such a secret keeper. Some people recount what you told them instantaneously, the others
take some time to do so</i>. That is, an information&rsquo;s substance is effective internally..that
it will perhaps change how you would act (whether against the secret owner or whoever is
related to it), this is correlated to our human naturalism, actually the point that makes us
think that a secret, a problem, a complaint might be fine to tell is a derivative of a human
nature; the social animal. Most secrets are problematic just like complaints, but would
spearing your complaints solve your problems? Well, 70,000 years ago it might do but now it
obviously won&rsquo;t, the reason of the propagation of secrets is similar to the complaining&rsquo;s;
our human nature is trying to extenuate the insecurities of doing/knowing something
problematic; thinking that would help us. I will talk about privacy later, but the
conclusion is that you are exposed<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
