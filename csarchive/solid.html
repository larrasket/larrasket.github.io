<div id="outline-container-orgd3ad355" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd3ad355">Single Responsibility Principle</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd3ad355">
<p>
Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob, is credited with coming up with the single
responsibility principle. He's defined it a number of times, but the definition I like best
is this one:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Each software module should have one and only one reason to change.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
This is a useful definition, but you probably still have some questions. What's a module in
the context of a C# program? A module in this case might refer to a class or even a single
function. Okay, but what about a reason to change? What does that mean, and how does it
relate to responsibilities?.
</p>

<p>
The individual classes and methods in our applications define what the application does and
how it does it. We can often improve the design of our software if we're able to separate
the what from the how. We do this through delegation and encapsulation. Classes should
encapsulate doing a particular task in a particular way. When they're single-purpose,
they're usually perfectly suited to this purpose and easy to use. Other classes can delegate
the specific task to an instance of a class that encapsulates performing that task. When
classes do too many things, they often end up coupling together things that shouldn't be
related and make the overall class much harder to use. Trying to provide a general purpose
tool results in additional complexity that a single-purpose tool wouldn't require.
</p>

<p>
What is a responsibility? It's a decision our code is making about the specific
implementation details of some part of what the application does. It's the answer to the
question of how something is done. Some examples of responsibilities include persistence,
logging, validation, and, of course, business logic.  How is the application or even just
this one class going to deal with persistence? Is it using files, a database, some Web API?
What about logging? Is there some particular framework being used? How is input to the
system validated? What about business entities?  How do we know if they're valid for a
particular operation? Where does the code go to enforce this? Mixed into all of these
concerns might be business rules that actually define how the system should behave from the
stakeholders perspective. They may not care about the low-level details of how files are
stored or logs are written, but they definitely care that the system models the business
problem correctly. SRP suggests that modules should have only one reason to change. Each of
these decisions may need to be reevaluated in the future.  Persistence might need to change
from files to a database. The initial choice of logging may prove insufficient, and a new
framework or provider may need to be added. Validation rules or even the way validation is
performed might need to be updated in the future. And, of course, business logic is a broad
category full of many possible responsibilities, any of which might change at different
times and for different reasons.
</p>

<p>
Keep this in mind.  <b>Responsibilities in your code represent things that may change at
different times and for different reasons</b>. Another way to think about this is that each
responsibility is a different axis of change. The potential source of changes to your
application can help you identify when you might be violating SRP. Even if you work for a
small company, you might think about where change requests originate in terms of different
executives within a large company. For example, the CIO may require a change to persistence
because of a companywide change in database vendors. The security officer may require a more
robust logging framework be installed to help detect and protect against attackers. The
chief operations officer may be responsible for ensuring that your system integrates
effectively with your company's newly acquired subsidiary requiring you to update your
validation rules. And perhaps marketing just announced a special offering, and now the price
calculations that your business rules model need to account for this new offer.

<div id="outline-container-org6e03067" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6e03067">Open / Closed Principle</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6e03067">
<p>
The open closed principle, or OCP, is the second of the SOLID principles. OCP says that
software entities like classes, modules, functions, and so on, should be open for extension
but closed for modification. Dr. Bertrand Meyer is credited with originating the term in his
1988 book, Object-Oriented Software Construction.
</p>

<p>
It should be possible to change the behavior of a method without having to edit its source
code. Imagine you have a function in your program that does something. Now a new requirement
comes along that needs to tweak how it works in certain cases. The typical approach most
developers will take, which is perfectly reasonable, is to add some logic to the function so
that it does one thing some of the time and something else at other times. This approach is
fine most of the time and for simple functions. However, as complexity grows, you should
think about how you might apply OCP so that you're not having to continually perform surgery
on the same function every time a new requirement arises. Let's break this down a bit
further. Open to extension in this case means that it's easy to add new behavior. If a
module in our application is closed to extension, it simply means that it has fixed
behavior. We can't change it. On the other side, closed to modification means that it's
unnecessary to change the source or binary code of the system. Code that is closed to
extension can't be changed without changing the code itself. So by definition, it is not
closed to modification.
</p>


<p>
The less we need to change the source of our code, the less likely it is that we'll
introduce new bugs into it. We also won't need to redeploy that code, and that reduces the
risk of downtime and the impact on downstream dependencies on that module. Code that is open
to extension usually has fewer conditional statements than code that is closed to extension,
which means it's probably simpler code that's easier to understand and test. And it's worth
noting that when we find actual bugs in our code, even if it's otherwise closed to
modification, it's perfectly acceptable to apply these directly to the code in question
unless there's a better place to apply the fix. So, basically, even if you're following OCP,
bug fixes should be an exception to that principle's rule, and you should be perfectly fine
to apply those as actual changes to the source code when you need to.

<p>
The original definition of the Liskov Substitution Principle reads Let phi of x be a property
provable about objects x of type T. Then phi of y should be true for objects y of type S
where S is a subtype of T.
