I was thinking in the first place to make this file just a part of the major C# note file,
but I believe that I might and will face a lot of filesystem topics, however I'm sure I will
not ever solve such a problem using C# (don't shout, microsoft kid), but surely it will be
useful to know. (Actually no, it probably will not but I Wall feel insecure if I didn't know
it).

<h3 id="org20b89d6">Check if a File Exist</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org20b89d6">
<p>
Sometimes when we're processing a file, we don't want to process a file that doesn't exist,
so before we start processing anything, let's check if the user really knows the statue of
the file he/she passed. This should be very straight forward using the <code>file</code> class:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-csharp"><span style="font-weight: bold;">public</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">void</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Process</span>()
{
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">WriteLine</span>($<span style="font-style: italic;">"Begin process of {InputFilePath}"</span>);
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">if</span> (File.<span style="font-weight: bold;">Exists</span>(InputFilePath)) <span style="font-weight: bold;">throw</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">new</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">FileNotFoundException</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">"Couldn't find input file at"</span>, InputFilePath);
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">else</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">WriteLine</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">"File is found successfully."</span>);
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You can also check if the path is qualified or not<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> before passing it:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-csharp"><span style="font-weight: bold;">while</span> (!Path.<span style="font-weight: bold;">IsPathFullyQualified</span>(filePath))
{
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">WriteLine</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">"The path"</span> + filePath + <span style="font-style: italic;">"is not fully qualified, please enter a qualified path."</span>);
    args[1] = (filePath = <span style="font-weight: bold;">ReadLine</span>());
}
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org07757cf" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org07757cf">Getting the Parent Directory</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org07757cf">
<p>
The application we're building is going to make use of a specific directory structure. We've
already seen that we've got this in directory. This is a child directory in this case of the
directory. So we can think of this directory as the root directory that the
processing will take place
As part of the processing of a file, it's going
to be copied and moved around. To be able to do this, we want to get the root data
directory.
</p>

<p>
What we want to do is calculate the parent directory of this in directory. So
let's start off by creating a new variable of type string called rootDirectoryPath:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-csharp"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">string</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">rootDirectoryPath</span> = (info.Parent.Parent.Exists) ? info.Parent.Parent.FullName : info.Parent.FullName;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We're going to be able to use this rootDirectoryPath later in this module. What we're going
to do is create an instance of this DirectoryInfo class. When we create an instance of a
DirectoryInfo class, we specify the initial path. In our case, it's the InputFilePath
property. So now we've got this DirectoryInfo instance, we can make use of its properties
and methods, one of which is this Parent property. This Parent property also returns an
instance of DirectoryInfo. So if we access this Parent property, it gives us a new
DirectoryInfo instance, this time representing the parent of the InputFilePath. And then we
can use the FullName property here to get the full path to this parent directory.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd10b3f7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd10b3f7">Checking if a Directory Exist and Creating New Ones</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd10b3f7">
<p>
As part of the processing of a file, this application is going to make a backup copy of the
original file in case something goes wrong during processing. So here we are in the
FileProcessor's Process method and we've got the rootDirectoryPath now. What we want to do
is create the backup directory under the root directory if it doesn't already exist. So the
first thing we're going to do is check if the backup directory already exists.
</p>

<p>
While I'm here, I'm also going to create a constant representing an InProgressDirectoryName
and a CompletedDirectoryName constant. We'll be making use of these other two constants
shortly. Let's come back down here and we'll add a string variable called
backupDirectoryPath. What we want to do now is use the rootDirectoryPath that we've already
calculated and append to it the BackupDirectoryName held in the constant. So we could do
something like:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-csharp">BackupDirectoryName = rootDirectoryPath + <span style="font-style: italic;">"\+ + BackUpPath"</span>;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
And use basic string manipulation, <b>do not do this</b>, your program will not compile in other
platforms that uses relative pathing or other pathing methods. There's actually a better
way, and that's to use the Path class. Instead reference the Path class that we've already
used:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-csharp">BackUpDirPath = Path.<span style="font-weight: bold;">Combine</span>(rootDirectoryPath, BackUpDirName);
</pre>
</div>

<p>
If you have fragments representing a path that you want to join together, rather than
using basic string manipulation in C#, you can instead call the Combine method of the Path
class. We can provide the Combine method with a number of individual strings representing
the path that we want to create. In our case here, we want to combine the ~rootDirectoryPath
that we just calculated with the string held in the BackupDirectoryName constant.
</p>

<p>
Now we have a path that represents where the backup directory should be, we can write an if
statement to check if it exists or not. To check if a directory exists, we can make use of
the Directory class and call its Exists method. As a parameter to this method, we can
provide the path to the directory we want to check. In this case, it's the
backupDirectoryPath that we just calculated using the Path.Combine method. If the directory
doesn't already exist, we want to go and create it.
</p>

<p>
We can make use of the Directory class and call the CreateDirectory method. As a parameter
to the CreateDirectory method, we provide the path.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-csharp"><span style="font-weight: bold;">foreach</span> (<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">var</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">dir</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">in</span> PathsToCreat)
{
    <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">var</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">newPath</span> = Path.<span style="font-weight: bold;">Combine</span>(rootDirectoryPath, dir);
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">if</span> (!Directory.<span style="font-weight: bold;">Exists</span>(newPath))
    {
        Directory.<span style="font-weight: bold;">CreateDirectory</span>(newPath);
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">WriteLine</span>(dir + <span style="font-style: italic;">"directory is created"</span>);
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">continue</span>;
    }

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">WriteLine</span>(dir + <span style="font-style: italic;">"directory already exists"</span>);

<h3 id="org842a5d2">Copying a File</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org842a5d2">
<p>
So now we've got our backup directory created, we can go and copy the original input file to
it. In this way, we're going to make sure we have a backup copy of the original file in case
it gets corrupted during processing. The first thing we can do is actually get just the file
name component of the original path.
</p>

<p>
To do this, once again we're going to make use of the extremely helpful Path class, and
we're going to call the GetFileName method. There's also a similar method called GetFileName
without extension that just returns the file name without the extension such as .txt. But in
this case, we actually want to keep the extension, so we'll just call GetFileName.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-csharp"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">string</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">inputFileName</span> = Path.<span style="font-weight: bold;">GetFileName</span>(InputFilePath);
</pre>
</div>

<p>
As a parameter to this method, we pass the path. In this case, it's the full path to the
input file. So now we've just got the file name components of the InputFilePath.
</p>

<p>
Now we can make use of the File class and call the Copy method. This overload of the Copy method
requires the source file name and the destination file name. In our case, the source file
name is the original input file specified at the command line, and the destination file name
is this backupFilePath.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-csharp"><span style="font-weight: bold;">private</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">void</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">BackUpFile</span>()
{
    <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">var</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">backUpFilePath</span> = Path.<span style="font-weight: bold;">Combine</span>(<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">UtilityPaths</span>[<span style="font-style: italic;">"Backup"</span>], Path.<span style="font-weight: bold;">GetFileName</span>(InputFilePath));
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">if</span> (File.<span style="font-weight: bold;">Exists</span>(backUpFilePath)) <span style="font-weight: bold;">WriteLine</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">"Updating existing path..."</span>);
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">WriteLine</span>(<span style="font-style: italic;">"Created a new backup at "</span> + UtilityPaths[<span style="font-style: italic;">"Backup"</span>]);
    File.<span style="font-weight: bold;">Copy</span>(InputFilePath, backUpFilePath,<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">true</span>);

We may want to process files differently depending on their file extension. For example, we
might want to process .txt files differently from .csv files. To do so, use the
GetFileNameWithoutExtension method from the Path class, we're not going to do this, however,
because what we're going to do instead is append a GUID to the file name. This is going to
mean that if we process the same named input file twice, we'll have a unique file name
output to the completed directory.

To delete a file you use the <code>Delete</code> method in the <code>Directory</code> class, add a boolean value,
<code>true</code> to prevent exception, since the <code>Delete</code> method requires the directory to be empty.

<div id="outline-container-orge43a8cf" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge43a8cf">The <code>FileSystemWatcher</code> Class</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge43a8cf">
<p>
The Microsoft documentation says that the FileSystemWatcher class listens to the file system
change notifications and raises events when a directory or file in a directory changes. So
for example, say we have a directory, say, for example the input directory for our console
app, we can create a FileSystemWatcher instance and monitor this directory for changes. The
FileSystemWatcher listens for low‑level operating system file operations. And then in our
application code, we can respond to events raised by the FileSystemWatcher instance.
</p>

<p>
There's a number of different events that we can subscribe to. There's the created event,
which is raised when a file or directory is created. We have the changed event, which is
raised when a file or directory is modified. The renamed event, which occurs when a file or
directory is renamed. The deleted event, which allows us to respond to file or directory
deletions. And also, the error event, which we can subscribe to get notified when the
FileSystemWatcher is no longer able to continue monitoring changes or its internal buffer
overflows. We'll talk about the buffer in just a moment. One crucial thing to remember about
the FileSystemWatcher is that a single file operation may result in multiple events being
raised. This has ramifications if we want to prevent single files being processed multiple
times.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org01d5cd2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org01d5cd2">Buffer and <code>BufferSize</code></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org01d5cd2">
<p>
Internally, the FileSystemWatcher makes use of a buffer. When file or directory operations
are detected by the FileSystemWatcher instance, they go into this buffer, and then the
FileSystemWatcher raises its events. The purpose of this buffer is to allow the
FileSystemWatcher enough time to raise its events, even if we have a lot of operations
happening on disk. We can configure the size of this buffer by setting the
InternalBufferSize property. The InternalBufferSize property is of type int, and we can
specify a buffer size from 4 KB all the way up to 64 KB. If we don't specify a value for the
InternalBufferSize property, it defaults to 8 K. Each individual operation in the file
system that's detected requires 16 bytes in the buffer plus an additional number of bytes
depending on the file name.
</p>


<p>
Microsoft also recommends that this InternalBufferSize property
is set to a multiple of 4 K on Intel‑based systems. To quote from the Microsoft
documentation, if there are many changes in a short time, the buffer can overflow. This
causes the component to lose track of changes in the directory. Increasing the size of the
buffer can prevent missing file system change events. Increasing buffer size is expensive
because it comes from non‑paged memory that cannot be swapped out to disk, so keep the
buffer as small as possible. Exactly what buffer size you'll need to set for your
application will depend on the frequency of file operations that happen to the watched,
directory or file. So for example, if you only have one or two files every day dropped into
a watched directory, you probably won't need to modify the default buffer size property. At
the other end of the spectrum, if you expect hundreds or thousands of operations to occur in
a short space of time, you may want to increase the size of the buffer. One way to reduce
the number of events that occur, and thus help prevent buffer overflows, is to configure
notification filters.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7b0cbe5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7b0cbe5">Notification Filters</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7b0cbe5">
<p>
We can configure the types of changes that we want to receive notifications for. To do this,
we set the NotifyFilter property on the FileSystemWatcher object. This NotifyFilter property
is an enum of type NotifyFilters. This enum contains a number of values, allowing us to
specify that we want notifications for attribute changes,
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Changes in the creation time.</li>
<li>Changes in the name of the director.</li>
<li>Changes in the name of the file.</li>
<li>Changes in the file or directory's last opened date.</li>
<li>Changes in the last write date.</li>
<li>Changes in the file or directory security settings.</li>
<li>Changes in the file or directory size.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We can also combine multiple NotifyFilters together if we want to be notified of multiple
change types.

<h3 id="orga074fc1">Other Properties</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga074fc1">
<p>
There's a number of additional properties that we can make use of on the FileSystemWatcher.
The first is the Path property. This allows us to specify a path to a directory or file to
be watched. The Filter property allows us to restrict the type of files that cause change
notifications. So, for example, we could specify <code>*.txt</code>, and we'd only get notifications for
changes in text files.
</p>

<p>
And we also have the EnableRaisingEvents property. By default, this
is false, which means that the specified path is not being watched. When we're ready to
start receiving events from the FileSystemWatcher, we simply set this property to true.
