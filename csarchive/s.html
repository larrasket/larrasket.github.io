The systems development life cycle (SDLC), contains the fundamental four- phase model
(planning, analysis, design, and implementation) common to all information  systems
development projects. It describes the evolution of system development method- ologies and
discusses the roles and skills required of a systems analyst. Th e chapter then  overviews
the basic characteristics of object-oriented systems and the fundamentals of object-oriented
systems analysis and design and closes with a description of the Unified Process and its
extentions and Unified Modeling Language

<h3 id="org4d4a323">A Cries</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4d4a323">
<p>
Let's take a look at how the software engineering cries has been formed:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A 1996 survey by the Standish Group found that <b>42 percent of all corporate IS projects were abandoned before completion</b>.</li>
<li>A similar study conducted in 1996 by the General Accounting Office found <b>53 percent of all U.S. government IS projects were abandoned</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Many of the systems that are not abandoned are delivered to the users:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Significantly late.</li>
<li>Cost far more than planned.</li>
<li>Have fewer features than originally planned.</li>
</ul>

<p>
IAG Consulting reports that <span class="underline">80 percent of the projects were over time</span>, <span class="underline">72 percent were
over budget</span>, and <span class="underline">55 percent contained less than the full functionality</span>; Panorama
Consulting Solutions reports that <span class="underline">54 percent of the ERP projects were over time,</span> <span class="underline">56
percent were over budget,</span> and <span class="underline">48 percent delivered less than 50 percent of the initial
benefits;</span> and an IBM study reports that 59 percent of the projects missed one or more of on
time, within budget, and quality constraints.

<h3 id="org28366be">System Development Life Cycle</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org28366be">
<p>
In many ways, building an information system is similar to building a house. First, the house
(or the information system) starts with a basic idea. Second, this idea is transformed into a
simple drawing that is shown to the customer and refined (often through several drawings,
each improving on the last) until the customer agrees that the picture depicts what he or she
wants. Third, a set of blueprints is designed that presents much more detailed information about
the house (e.g., the type of water faucets or where the telephone jacks will be placed). Finally,
the house is built following the blueprints, often with some changes directed by the customer
as the house is erected.
</p>

<p>
The SDLC has a similar set of four fundamental phases: planning, analysis, design, and
implementation. Different projects might emphasize different parts of the SDLC or approach the
SDLC phases in different ways, but all projects have elements of these four phases. Each phase is
itself composed of a series of steps, which rely upon techniques that produce deliverables (specific
documents and files that provide understanding about the project).
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org263c682" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org263c682">Planing</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org263c682">
<p>
The planning phase is the fundamental process of understanding <i>why</i> an information system
should be built and determining <i>how</i> the project team will go about building it. It has two
steps:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>During project initiation, the system’s business value to the organization is identified.
 How will it <span class="underline">lower costs</span> or <span class="underline">increase revenues</span><sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>? Most ideas for new systems <b>come
from outside the IS area</b> (e.g., <i>from the marketing department, accounting department</i>) in
the form of a <i>system request</i>. A system request presents a brief summary of a <i>business
need</i>, and it explains how a system that supports the need will create business value. The
IS department works together with the person or department that generated the request
(called the project sponsor) to conduct a feasibility analysis.</li>
<li>Once the project is approved, it enters project management.
During project management, the project manager creates a workplan, staffs the project,
and puts techniques in place to help the project team control and direct the project
through the entire SDLC. The deliverable for project management is a project plan, which
describes how the project team will go about developing the system.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org062f1ac" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org062f1ac">Analysis</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org062f1ac">
<p>
The analysis phase answers the questions of <i>who</i> will use the system, what the system will
<i>do</i>, and <i>where and when</i> it will be used. During this phase, the project team <i>investigates any
current system(s),</i> <i>identifies opportunities for improvement</i>, <i>and develops a concept for the
new system</i>.
</p>

<p>
It has 3 steps:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>An analysis strategy is developed to guide the project team’s efforts.
Such a strategy usually includes an analysis of the current system (called the <i>as-is
system</i>) and its problems and then ways to design a new system (called the <i>to-be system</i>).</li>
<li>The next step is requirements gathering (e.g., through interviews or questionnaires).
 The analysis of this information—in conjunction with input from the project sponsor and
many other people—leads to the development of a concept for a new system.</li>
<li>The analyses, system concept, and models are combined into a document called the system proposal.
 which is presented to the project sponsor and other key decision makers (e.g., members
 of the approval committee) who decide whether the project should continue to move
forward. (of course, before it even starts)</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4eec8a7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4eec8a7">Design</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4eec8a7">
<p>
The design phase decides how the system will operate, in terms of the hardware, software,
and network infrastructure; the user interface, forms, and reports; and the specific programs,
databases, and files that will be needed. Although most of the strategic decisions about the
system were made in the development of the system concept during the analysis phase, the
steps in the design phase determine exactly how the system will operate. The design phase
has four steps:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The design strategy is first developed.
It clarifies whether the system will be developed by the company’s own programmers,
whether the system will be outsourced to another firm (usually a consulting firm), or
whether the company will buy an existing software package.</li>
<li>This leads to the development of the basic architecture design for the system.
which describes the hardware, software, and network infrastructure to be used. In most
cases, the system will add or change the infrastructure that already exists in the
organization. The interface design specifies how the users will move through the sys- tem
(e.g., navigation methods such as menus and on-screen buttons) and the forms and reports
that the system will use.</li>
<li>The database and file specifications are developed.
These define exactly what data will be stored and where they will be stored.</li>
<li>The analyst team develops the program design, which defines the programs that need to be written and exactly what each program will do.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga73bf79" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orga73bf79">Implementation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga73bf79">
<p>
The final phase in the SDLC is the implementation phase, during which the system is actually
built (or purchased, in the case of a packaged software design). This is the phase that usually
gets the most attention, because for most systems it is the longest and most expensive single
part of the development process. This phase has three steps:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>System construction is the first step.
The system is built and tested to ensure that it performs as designed. Because the cost
of bugs can be immense, testing is one of the most critical steps in implementation. Most
organizations give more time and attention to testing than to writing the programs in the
first place.</li>
<li>The system is installed.
Installation is the process by which the old system is turned off and the new one is
turned on. One of the most important aspects of conversion is the development of a <span class="underline">training
plan to teach users how to use the new system</span> and help manage the changes caused by the new
system.</li>
<li>The analyst team establishes a support plan for the system.
This plan usually includes a formal or informal post-implementation review as well as a
systematic way for identifying major and minor changes needed for the system.</li>

<div id="outline-container-org18f0bdb" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org18f0bdb">Methodologies</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org18f0bdb">
<p>
A methodology is a formalized approach to implementing the SDLC (i.e., it is a list of steps
and deliverables). There are many different systems development methodologies, and each
one is unique, based on the order and focus it places on each SDLC phase. Some methodolo-
gies are formal standards used by government agencies, whereas others have been developed
by consulting firms to sell to clients. Many organizations have internal methodologies that
have been honed over the years, and they explain exactly how each phase of the SDLC is to
be performed in that company.
</p>

<p>
There are many ways to categorize methodologies. One way is by looking at whether
they focus on business processes or the data that support the business. A process-centered
methodology emphasizes process models as the core of the system concept.
</p>

<p>
Another important factor in categorizing methodologies is the sequencing of the SDLC phases
and the amount of time and effort devoted to each. In the early days of computing,
programmers did not understand the need for formal and well-planned life-cycle
methodologies. They tended to move directly from a very simple planning phase right into the
construction step of the implementation phase—in other words, from a very fuzzy, not-well-
thought-out system request into writing code. This is the same approach that you sometimes
use when writing programs for a programming class. It can work for small programs that
require only one programmer, but if the requirements are complex or unclear, you might
miss important aspects of the problem and have to start all over again, throwing away part of
the program (and the time and effort spent writing it). This approach also makes teamwork
difficult because members have little idea about what needs to be accomplished and how to
work together to produce a final product. In this section, we describe three different classes of
system development methodologies: structured design, rapid application development, and
agile development.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org48ac2f7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org48ac2f7">Structured Design</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org48ac2f7">
<p>
The first category of systems development methodologies is called structured design.
These methodologies became dominant in the 1980s, replacing the previous ad hoc and
undisciplined approach. Structured design methodologies adopt a formal step-by-step
approach to the SDLC that moves logically from one phase to the next. Numerous pro-
cess-centered and data-centered methodologies follow the basic approach of the two struc-
tured design categories outlined next.
</p>

<p>
Waterfall Development The original structured design methodology (still used today) is
waterfall development. With waterfall development-based methodologies, the analysts and
users proceed in sequence from one phase to the next. The key deliverables
for each phase are typically very long (often hundreds of pages in length) and are presented to
the project sponsor for approval as the project moves from phase to phase. Once the sponsor
approves the work that was conducted for a phase, the phase ends and the next one begins.
This methodology is referred to as waterfall development because it moves forward from
phase to phase in the same manner as a waterfall. Although it is possible to go backward in
the SDLC (e.g., from design back to analysis), it is extremely difficult.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Structured design also introduced the use of formal modeling or diagramming tech-
niques to describe the basic business processes and the data that support them. Traditional
structured design uses one set of diagrams to represent the processes and a separate set of
diagrams to represent data. Because two sets of diagrams are used, the systems analyst must
decide which set to develop first and use as the core of the system: process-model diagrams
or data-model diagrams.
</p>

<p>
The two key advantages of the structured design waterfall approach are that it identi-
fies system requirements long before programming begins and it minimizes changes to the
requirements as the project proceeds.
</p>

<p>
The two key disadvantages are that the design must be completely specified before
programming begins and that a long time elapses between the completion of the system
proposal in the analysis phase and the delivery of the system (usu- ally many months or
years). If the project team misses important requirements, expensive post-implementation
programming may be needed (imagine yourself trying to design a car on paper; how likely
would you be to remember interior lights that come on when the doors open or to specify the
right number of valves on the engine?). A system can also require significant rework because
the business environment has changed from the time when the analysis phase occurred.
</p>


<p>
Parallel development methodology attempts to address the problem of long delays between the
analysis phase and the delivery of the system. Instead of doing design and implementation in
sequence, it performs a general design for the whole system and then divides the project
into a series of distinct subprojects that can be designed and implemented in parallel. Once
all subprojects are complete, the separate pieces are integrated and the system is delivered.
</p>

<p>
(BROKEN)
</p>

<p>
The primary advantage of this methodology is that it can reduce the time to deliver a
system; thus, there is less chance of changes in the business environment causing rework.
However, sometimes the subprojects are not completely independent; design decisions made in
one subproject can affect another, and the end of the project can require significant
integration efforts.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcdbf931" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgcdbf931">Rapid Application Development</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgcdbf931">
<p>
A second category of methodologies includes rapid application development (RAD)-based
methodologies. These are a newer class of systems development methodologies that emerged in
the 1990s. RAD-based methodologies attempt to address both weaknesses of structured design
methodologies by adjusting the SDLC phases to get some part of the system devel- oped
quickly and into the hands of the users. In this way, the users can better understand the
system and suggest revisions that bring the system closer to what is needed.
</p>

<p>
(BROKEN)
</p>

<p>
Most RAD-based methodologies recommend that analysts use special techniques
and computer tools to speed up the analysis, design, and implementation phases, such as
computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools, joint application design (JAD) sessions,
fourth-generation or visual programming languages that simplify and speed up programming,
and code generators that automatically produce programs from design specifications. The
combination of the changed SDLC phases and the use of these tools and techniques improves
the speed and quality of systems development. However, there is one possible subtle problem
with RAD-based methodologies: managing user expectations. Owing to the use of the tools and
techniques that can improve the speed and quality of systems development, user expectations
of what is possible can change dramatically. As a user better understands the information
technology (IT), the systems requirements tend to expand. This was less of a problem when
using methodologies that spent a lot of time thoroughly documenting requirements.

<h5 id="orgdcdfc8d">Pashed Development</h5>
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-orgdcdfc8d">
<p>
A phased development-based methodology breaks an overall system into a series of versions
that are developed sequentially. The analysis phase identifies the overall system concept,
and the project team, users, and system sponsor then categorize the requirements into a
series of versions. The most important and fundamental requirements are bundled into the
first version of the system. The analysis phase then leads into design and
implementation—but only with the set of requirements identified for version 1:
</p>

<p>
(BROKEN)
</p>

<p>
Once version 1 is implemented, work begins on version 2. Additional analysis is per-
formed based on the previously identified requirements and combined with new ideas and
issues that arose from the users’ experience with version 1. Version 2 then is designed and
implemented, and work immediately begins on the next version. This process continues until
the system is complete or is no longer in use.
