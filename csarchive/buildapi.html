<h2 id="orgcc01733">Introduction, The Richardson Maturity Model</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcc01733">
<div class="PREVIEW" id="org48595d0">
<p>
The Richardson Maturity Model is a model developed by Leonard Richardson. It grades, if you
will, APIs by the their RESTful maturity. So it's interesting to look at it, as it shows us
how we can go from a simple API that doesn't really care about protocol, nor standards. To
an API, that can be considered RESTful.
</p>

</div>


<p>
The first level is level 0, the Swamp of POX, or Plain Old XML. This level states that the
implementing protocol, HTTP, is used for remote interaction, but we just use it as that, and
we don't use anything else from the protocol correctly. So, for example, to get some author
data, you send over a POST request to some basic entry point URI, like <code>host/myapi</code>. In the
body, you send some XML that contains info on the data you want. You then get back the data
you asked for in the response. To create an author, you create another POST request with
some data in the body to that same entry point URI, and so on. In other words, you use HTTP,
<b>but only as a transport protocol</b>. An example of this is SOAP<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup> , or other typical remote
procedure call implementations. It's not a completely correct statement, but you see a lot
of these RPC-style implementations when building services with Windows Communication
Foundation.
</p>

<p>
Then we have a level 1, Resources.  From this moment on, you use multiple URIs,
and each URI is mapped to a specific resource.  So it extends on level 0, where there was
only 1 URI. For example, we now have URI host/api/authors to get a list of authors,
api/authors/id for an author with a specific id, and so on. However, only one method, like
POST, is still used for all interactions. So, HTTP methods aren't used as they should be,
according to the standard. This is already a little part of the uniform interface constraint
we see here, by the way. From a software design point of view, this means reducing
complexity by working with different end points instead of one large service end point.
</p>

<p>
Then
we have level 2, Verbs. To reach a level 2 API, the correct HTTP verbs like GETS, POST, PUT,
PATCH, and DELETE are used as they are intended by the protocol. In the example, we see a
GET request to get a list of authors, and a POST request containing a resource for
presentation in the body for creating an author. The correct status codes are also included
in this level. For example, use a 200 OK after a successful GET, a 201 Created after a
successful POST, and so on.
</p>

<p>
This again adds to
that uniform interface constraint. And from a software design point of view, we have just
removed unnecessary variation. We are using the same verbs to handle the same types of
situations. Level 3, or Hypermedia controls. This means that the API supports HATEOAS,
another part of that uniform interface constraint. A sample GET request to the authors
resource would then return not only the list of authors, but also links, hypermedia, that
drive application state. From a software design point of view, this means we've introduced
discoverability and self documentation. What is important to know is that according to Roy
Fielding, a level 3 API is a precondition to be able to talk about the RESTful API. So, this
maturity model does not mean there's such a thing as a level 1 RESTful API, a level 2
RESTful API, and a level 3 RESTful API. It means that there are APIs of 3 different levels,
and only when you reach level 3, you can start talking about the RESTful API.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5270a74" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org5270a74">Structuring Outer Facing Contract</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5270a74">
<p>
It consists of three big concept consumer of an API uses to interact with that API. First,
resource identifiers, ie. the URIs where the resources can be found. That's combined with
HTTP methods like get to get resources, post to create them, and all the ones we'll look
into. These methods are part of the HTTP standard. Third, an optional payload. When creating
a resource, the HTTP request will have to contain representation of the resource you want to
create. When getting a resource, the http response will contain a resource representation in
its body. The format of those representations is what media types are used for like
application Json.
</p>

<p>
The uniform interface constraint does cover the fact that resources are identified by URIs.
Each resource has its own URI, but as far as naming of resources is concerned, there isn't a
standard that describes that. There are, however, best practices for this.
</p>

<p>
<b>Resource naming in the URI should always be a noun</b>. In other words, a RESTful URI should
refer to a resource that is a thing, instead of referring to an action. The action, that's
the HTTP method. So we shouldn't create a <i>getauthors</i> resource. That's an action, getting
the authors. We should create an author for resource. That's a thing conveyed by a noun and
use the Get method to get it to get one specific author with a dependent with a forward
slash and the authorId. Using these nouns conveys meaning, it describes the resource so we
shouldn't call resource authors when it's, in fact, about authors. This principle should be
followed throughout the API for predictability. It helps a consumer understand the API
structure. If you have another non-hierarchical resource, say employees, we shouldn't name
it api/something/somethingelse/employees. We should name it api/employees. A single employee
shouldn't be named id/employees, it should be named employees/employeeId. This helps keep
the API contract predictable and consistent.
</p>

<p>
There is quite a bit of debate going on on whether or not we should pluralize these nouns. I
prefer to pluralize them as it helps to convey meaning again. When I see an authors
resource, that tells us it's a collection of authors and not one author, but good APIs that
don't pluralize nouns exists as well. If you prefer that, you can, but do make sure you stay
consistent. Either all resources should be pluralized nouns or all should be singular nouns
and not a mix.
</p>

<p>
Another important thing you'd want represented in an API contract is hierarchy. Our data or
models have structure, for example, in all the REST courses. That should be represented in
the API contract. So if we want to define an authors courses where the course is in the
model hierarchy or children of an author, we should represent them as
<code>api/authors/authorId/courses</code>. A single course by an author should then be defined as
API/authors/authorId/courses/courseID. APIs often expose additional capabilities like
allowing filtering resources or ordering them. Those parameters should be passed through via
the credit string. So we shouldn't write something along the lines of
api/authors/orderby/name. There is a few contract smiles in that your URI. A plural noun
should always be followed by an id and not by another noun or word. Orderby isn't a noun and
a URI like that would mean we'd have defined three different resources, authors,
authors/orderby, and authors/orderby/name. That's not what we wanted to do. We don't want to
define new resources, we want to order our already-existing authors resource. So
api/authors?orderby=name is a better fit.
</p>


<p>
There always has to be an exception. Life would be too easy without it. Sometimes there is
these RPC-style calls like calculate total that don't easily map to resources. Most
RPC-style calls do map to resources as we've just proven. We don't have a get authors by
name procedure, we have api/orders? orderby=name, but what if we need to calculate, say, the
total amount of pages in order wrote in these courses? And let's assume for the sake of the
example that it's a very productive author, calculating this would take quite a bit of time
and we don't want to send it over together with every author by default.  It's not that easy
to create resource from that using pluralized nouns. We'd end up with something like you see
on screen now, but then what? A resource like this means we'd expect it to return a
collection and not a number. We can go for something like api pagetotals/id where the
backend would then have to map that id to an authorId or it could even be the same Id and
that would work, but it does feel a bit out of place. So this is one of those exceptional
cases where I'd suggest to take a bit of a pragmatic approach. Api/authors/ the
authorId/totalamountofpages isn't according to the best practices we've just looked into,
but as long as it's an exceptional case, it doesn't mean you've suddenly got a bad API
contract. Remember, there is no standard for this. These are just guidelines. There are
other approaches possible as well, by the way, for example, implementing a system where you
can choose which author fields are returned in a resource.

<div id="outline-container-orgb8bdb88" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb8bdb88">Status Codes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb8bdb88">
<p>
We know by now that REST isn't a standard, but it does use standards. Status codes and when
to use them are part of the HTTP standard. It's really important to get this right because
these status codes are the only thing a consumer of an API, like a client-side web app, can
inspect to know if a request worked out as expected or if something went wrong and, if
something went wrong, whether it's the fault of the consumer or of the API itself. We're
currently returning JSON result in our code, which sends back a 200 status code by default.
But if we keep on sending back 200 OK status codes for each and every request, the consumer
of the API would assume the request worked out as expected even if it went wrong. Remember
that consumers of the API are typically non-human. All they can inspect is that status code,
and they can't read out and interpret error messages.
</p>

<p>
From time to time, problems arise.  Something goes wrong. If we only send back a 500
Internal Server Error in all those cases, the consumer would never know if it's his fault
that something went wrong. In the example in the code we just wrote, we're trying to get an
author that doesn't exist. That's a client mistake. It also means that the client can
correct it and try the request again. Other times, it's the server's responsibility, for
example the database is unavailable. The consumer of the API cannot correct this because the
mistake isn't his. There's a lot of status codes, and an API doesn't necessarily have to
support all of them. But let's have a look at a few common ones.
</p>

<p>
There's five levels of status codes. Level 100 status codes are informational and weren't
part of the HTTP1 standard. These are currently not used by APIs.  The level 200 status
codes mean the request went well. The most common ones are 200 for a successful request, 201
for a successful request that resulted in the creation of new resource, and 204 for a
successful request that shouldn't return anything, like when you delete something.
</p>

<p>
Level 300 status codes are used for redirection, for example to tell a search engine a page
that's permanently moved. Most APIs don't have a need for these.
</p>

<p>
Then there's the status codes that tell the consumer he did something wrong. Level 400,
Client Mistakes. 400 means a bad request. The request you, as a consumer of the API sent to
the server is wrong. For example, the JSON the consumer provided can't be parsed. 401
Unauthorized means that no or invalid authentication details were provided. 403 Forbidden
means that authentication succeeded, but the authenticated user doesn't have access to the
requested resource. 404 Not Found means that the requested resource doesn't exist.
</p>

<p>
And there's more. 405 means method not allowed. This happens when we try to send a request
to a resource with an HTTP method that isn't allowed. For example, we try to send a POST
request to api/authors when only GET is implemented on that resource. Another interesting
one is 406 Not Acceptable. Now we're diving into the presentation media types. This status
code means that the consumer of the API requested representation in a format that isn't
supported by the API. And the API doesn't supply a default representation. For example, a
consumer might request the application/xml media type, while the API only supports
application/json and doesn't provide that as default representation.
</p>

<p>
Another interesting one is 409 Conflict.  That means that there's a conflict with the
request versus the current state of the resource the request is sent to. It's often used
when you're trying to edit version of the resource that hasn't been renewed since you
started editing it. But it's also used when trying to create a resource that already exists.
This is one of the status codes used for concurrency issues. 415 means unsupported media
type. That's the other way around from the 406 status code. Sometimes we have to provide
data to our API in the request body, when creating a resource for example. That data also
has a specific media type. If the API doesn't support this, a 415 status code is returned.
And then the last one we'll cover is 422. That stands for Unprocessable Entity. It's part of
the WebDAV HTTP extension standard, so it wasn't in the basic standard. It's an interesting
one though because this one means that the server understands the content type of the
request entity, which means 415 is inappropriate. Next to that, the syntax of the request
entity is correct.  So a 400 is inappropriate. But still, the server was unable to process
the contained instructions. So it's typically used for semantic mistakes. And semantic
mistakes, that's what we get when working with validation. So if a validation rule fails, a
422 is what should be returned. And lastly, there's level 500 server mistakes. Often, only a
500 Internal Server Error is supported. This means that the server made a mistake, and the
client can't do anything about it other than trying again later. That's a lot of status
codes, but there's no reason to learn them by heart. We'll look into them when we encounter
them.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0a2b39e">
<p>
So, mistakes happen. These mistakes are then categorized in two categories, errors and
faults. Errors are defined as a consumer of an API, like a web application, passing invalid
data to the API, and the API correctly rejecting that data. Examples include invalid
credentials, incorrect parameters, unknown version IDs, or similar. In other words, these
are level 400 status codes, and they are the result of a client passing incorrect or invalid
data to the API. Errors do not contribute to overall API availability. Faults are defined as
the API failing to correctly return a response to a valid request by a consumer. In other
words, the API made a mistake. These are level 500 status codes, and they do contribute to
the overall API availability.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgcee8021">
<p>
When we design the outer-facing contract, we already learned that REST stops at that level.
What lies underneath that outer-facing contract is of no importance to REST. From that, we
already know that the entity model, in our case used by Entity Framework Core as a means to
represent database rows as object, should be different from the outer-facing model. Those
model classes represent what's sent over the wire. Sometimes you see these models referred
to as your DTOs (Data-Transfer Object) or even ViewModels. But that also leads to
possibilities. Take an author, for example. We can see some pseudocode for that.
An author is stored in our database with a DateOfBirth. But that DateOfBirth, well, that
might not be what we want to offer up to the consumers of the API. They might be better off
with the Age. Another example might be concatenation, concatenating FirstName and LastName
from an entity into one name field in the resource representation. And sometimes data might
come from different places.  An author could have a field, say Royalties, that comes from
another API our API must interact with. That alone leads to issues when using entity classes
for the outer-facing contract as they don't contain that field. Keeping these models
separate leads to more robust reliably evolvable code.
</p>

<p>
Imagine having to change a database table. That would lead to a change of the entity class.
If we're using that same entity class to directly expose data via the API, our clients might
run into problems because they're not expecting an additional renamed or removed field.
We're essentially making versioning very hard because by reusing those entity classes, the
database can't evolve separately from the API. So when developing, it's very important to
keep these separate.
