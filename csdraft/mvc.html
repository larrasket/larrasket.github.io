<p>
Creating a project shouldn't be a controversial thing, there is already predefined
templates in tools like <code>dotnet</code>, or embedded in IDEs. I'm going to use the one that
Jetbrains' Rider provides in this notebook, however, it's identical to the most of other
templates.
</p>

<p>
If you are Unix-like user, it's recommended not to use any symbolic links in the project/solution
path, use the full path.
</p>

<p>
When you’re new to a framework, creating an application from a template like this can
be a mixed blessing. On the one hand, you can get an application up and running
quickly, with little input required on your part. Conversely, the number of files can
sometimes be overwhelming, leaving you scratching your head working out where to
start. The basic web application template doesn’t contain a huge number of files and
folders, as shown in the following figure, but I’ll run through the major ones to get you oriented.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Inside the solution folder, you’ll find your project folder, which in turn contains five
subfolders—Models, Controllers, Views, Properties, and wwwroot. Models, Control-
lers, and Views (unsurprisingly) contain the MVC Model, Controller, and View files
you’ll use to build your application. The Properties folder contains a single file,
launchSettings.json, which controls how Visual Studio will run and debug the applica-
tion. The wwwroot folder is special, in that it’s the only folder in your application that
browsers are allowed to directly access when browsing your web app. You can store
your CSS, JavaScript, images, or static HTML files in here and browsers will be able to
access them. They won’t be able to access any file that lives outside of wwwroot.
</p>

<p>
Although the wwwroot and Properties folders exist on disk, you can see that Solution
Explorer shows them as special nodes, out of alphabetical order, near the top of
your project. You’ve got two more special nodes in the project, Dependencies and
Connected Services, but they don’t have a corresponding folder on disk. Instead, they
show a collection of all the dependencies, such as NuGet packages, client-side dependencies,
and remote services that the project relies on.
</p>

<p>
In the root of your project folder, you’ll find several <code>JSON</code> files, such as appsettings
<code>.json, bundleconfig.json</code>, and bower.json. These provide various configuration set-
tings, some of which are used at runtime, and others which are used to build your app at
compile time.

<p>
The request and response, the reverse proxy, and the ASP.NET Core web server are all still
there, but you’ll notice that I’ve expanded the ASP.NET Core application itself to show the
middleware pipeline and the MVC middleware. This is the main custom part
of your app that goes into generating the response from a request.
</p>

<p>
(BROKEN IMAGE (probably part of archived article, will not be revoked))
</p>

<p>
 The first port of call after the reverse proxy forwards a request is the ASP.NET
Core web server, which is the default cross-platform Kestrel server. Kestrel takes the
raw incoming request and uses it to generate an HttpContext object the rest of the
application to use.
</p>

<p>
Kestrel is responsible for receiving the request data and constructing a C# representa-
tion of the request, but it doesn’t attempt to handle the request directly. For that, Kes-
trel hands the HttpContext to the middleware pipeline found in every ASP.NET Core
application. This is a series of components that processes the incoming request to per-
form common operations such as logging, handling exceptions, or serving static files.
</p>

<p>
After the middleware pipeline comes the MVC block. This is responsible for generat-
ing the HTML that makes up the pages of a typical ASP.NET Core web app. It’s also
typically where you find most of the business logic of your app, by calling out to vari-
ous services in response to the data contained in the original request. Not every app
needs an MVC block, but it’s typically how you’ll build most apps that display HTML
to a user.
</p>

<p>
Most ASP.NET Core applications follow this basic architecture, and the example in
this chapter is no different. First, you’ll see how to create and run your application,
then we’ll look at how the code corresponds to the outline in figure 2.1. Without fur-
ther ado, let’s create an application!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org779ab5b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org779ab5b"><code>csproj</code>: Dependencies</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org779ab5b">
<p>
The csproj file is the project file for .NET applications and contains the details
required for the .NET tooling to build your project. It defines the type of project
being built (web app, console app, or library), which platform the project targets
(.NET Core, .NET Framework 4.5, Mono, and so on), and which NuGet packages the
project depends on.
</p>

<p>
 The project file has been a mainstay of .NET applications, but in ASP.NET Core it
has had a facelift to make it easier to read and edit. These changes include:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No GUIDs—Previously, Global Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) were used for many things, now they’re rarely used in the project file.</li>
<li>Implicit file includes—Previously, every file in the project had to be listed in the csproj file for it to be included in the build. Now, files are automatically com- piled.</li>
<li>No paths to NuGet package dlls—Previously, you had to include the path to the dll files contained in NuGet packages in the csproj, as well as listing the dependen- cies in a packages.xml file. Now, you can reference the NuGet package directly in your csproj, and don’t need to specify the path on disk.</li>
</ul>

<p>
All of these changes combine to make the project file far more compact than you’ll be
used to from previous .NET projects. The following listing shows the entire csproj file
for your small app.
</p>

<p>
For simple applications, you probably won’t need to change the project file much. The
Sdk attribute on the Project element includes default settings that describe how to build
your project, whereas the TargetFramework element describes the framework your appli-
cation will run on. For .NET Core 2.0 projects, this will have the netcoreapp2.0 value; if
you’re running on the full .NET Framework, 4.6.1, this would be net461.
</p>

<p>
The most common changes you’ll make to the project file are to add additional
NuGet packages using the PackageReference element. By default, your app refer-
ences a single NuGet package,  Microsoft.AspNetCore.All. This is a metapackage that
includes all of the packages associated with ASP.NET Core 2.0. It’s only available when
you’re targeting .NET Core.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org27bb426" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org27bb426">The Program Class</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org27bb426">
<p>
All ASP.NET Core applications start in the same way as .NET Console applications—
with a Program.cs file. This file contains a static void Main function, which is a stan-
dard characteristic of console apps. This method must exist and is called whenever
you start your web application. In ASP.NET Core applications, it’s used to build and
run an IWebHost instance, as shown in the following listing, which shows the default
Program.cs file. The IWebHost is the core of your ASP.NET Core application, contain-
ing the application configuration and the Kestrel server that listens for requests and
send response.
</p>

<p>
The Main function contains all the basic initialization code required to create a web
server and to start listening for requests. It uses a WebHostBuilder, created by the call
to CreateDefaultBuilder, to define how the IWebHost is configured, before instantiating the
<code>IWebHost</code> with a call to <code>Build()</code>.

</p>

<p>
ASP.NET Core uses small, modular components for each distinct feature. This allows
individual features to evolve separately, with only a loose coupling to others, and is
generally considered good design practice. The downside to this approach is that it
places the burden on the consumer of a feature to correctly instantiate it. Within your
application, these modular components are exposed as one or more services that are
used by the application.
</p>

<p>
For example, in an e-commerce app, you might have a <code>TaxCalculator</code> that calculates
the tax due on a particular product, taking into account the user’s location in the
world. Or you might have a <code>ShippingCostService</code> that calculates the cost of shipping
to a user’s location. A third service, <code>OrderTotalCalculatorService</code>, might use both
of these services to work out the total price the user must pay for an order. Each ser
vice provides a small piece of independent functionality, but you can combine them to
create a complete application. This is known as the single responsibility principle.
</p>

<p>
In an ASP.NET Core application, this registration is performed in the Configure-
Services method. Whenever you use a new ASP.NET Core feature in your application,
you’ll need to come back to this method and add in the necessary services.
</p>


<p>
The OrderTotalCalculatorService needs access to an instance of ShippingCost-
Service and TaxCalculator. A naïve approach to this problem is to use the new key-
word and create an instance of a service whenever you need it. Unfortunately, this
tightly couples your code to the specific implementation you’re using and can com-
pletely undo all the good work achieved by modularizing the features in the first
place. In some cases, it may break the SRP by making you perform initialization code
as well as using the service you created.
</p>


<p>
 One solution to this problem is to make it somebody else’s problem. When writing
a service, you can declare your dependencies and let another class fill those depen-
dencies for you. Your service can then focus on the functionality for which it was
designed, instead of trying to work out
how to build its dependencies.
</p>


<p>
Typically, you’ll register the dependencies of your application into a “container,”
which can then be used to create any service. This is true for both your own custom
application services and the framework services used by ASP.NET Core. You must register
each service with the container before it can be used in your application.
</p>

<p>
In an ASP.NET Core application, this registration is performed in the Configure-
Services method. Whenever you use a new ASP.NET Core feature in your applica-
tion, you’ll need to come back to this method and add in the necessary services. This
is not arduous as it sounds, as shown in the next example:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-csharp"><span style="font-weight: bold;">public</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">void</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">ConfigureServices</span>(<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">IServiceCollection</span> <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">services</span>)
{
    services.<span style="font-weight: bold;">AddControllersWithViews</span>();
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You may be surprised that a complete MVC application only includes a single call to
add the necessary services, but the <code>AddMvc()</code> method is an extension method that
encapsulates all the code required to set up the MVC services. Behind the scenes, it
adds various Razor services for rendering HTML, formatter services, routing services,
and many more!
</p>


<p>
 As well as registering framework-related services, this method is where you’d register
any custom services you have in your application, such as the example TaxCalculator
discussed previously. The <code>IServiceCollection</code> is a list of every known service that your
application will need to use. By adding a new service to it, you ensure that whenever a
class declares a dependency on your service, the IoC container knows how to provide it.
</p>

<p>
Defining how requests are handled with middleware
So far, in the <code>WebHostBuilder</code> and Startup class, you’ve defined the infrastructure of
the application and registered your services with the IoC container. In the final config-
uration method of Startup, Configure, you define the middleware pipeline for the
application, which is what defines the app’s behavior.
</p>


<p>
In development, DeveloperExceptionPageMiddleware (added by the <code>UseDeveloperExceptionPage()</code>
call) ensures that, if your application throws an exception that isn’t caught, you’ll be
presented with as much information as possible in the browser to diagnose the problem, as
shown in figure 2.10. It’s akin to the “yellow screen of death”
