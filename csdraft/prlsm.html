Let's start with the most known running process: the thread.
</p>

<p>
Instead of our classic view of a single point of execution within a program (i.e., a single
PC where instructions are being fetched from and executed), a multi-threaded program has
more than one point of execution (i.e., multiple PCs, each of which is being fetched and
executed from). Perhaps another way to think of this is that each thread is very much like a
a separate process, except for one difference: they share the same address space and thus can
access the same data.
</p>



<p>
Each thread has its own private set of registers it uses for computation; thus, if two
threads are running on a single processor, when switching from running one (T1) to running
the other (T2), a context switch must take place. The context switch between threads is
quite similar to the context switch between processes, as the register state of T1 must be
saved and the register state of T2 restored before running T2. With processes, we saved the
state to a process control block (PCB); now, weâ€™ll need one or more thread control blocks
(TCBs) to store the state of each thread of a process. There is one major difference,
though, in the context switch we perform between threads as compared to processes: the
address space remains the same (i.e., there is no need to switch which page table we are
using).
</p>

<h3 id="org2d8e0e7">Why Bother?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2d8e0e7">
<p>
There are at least two major reasons you should use threads. The first is simple:
parallelism. Imagine you are writing a program that performs operations on very large
arrays, for example, adding two large arrays together, or incrementing the value of each
element in the array by some amount. If you are running on just a single processor, the
task is straightforward: just perform each operation and be done.  However, if you are
executing the program on a system with multiple processors, you have the potential of
speeding up this process considerably by using the processors to each perform a portion of
the work. The task of transforming your standard single-threaded program into a program that
does this sort of work on multiple CPUs is called parallelization and using a thread per
CPU to do this work is a natural and typical way to make programs run faster on modern
hardware.
</p>


<p>
The second reason is a bit more subtle: to avoid blocking program progress due to slow I/O.
Imagine that you are writing a program that performs different types of I/O: either waiting
to send or receive a message, for an explicit disk I/O to complete, or even (implicitly) for
a page fault to finish. Instead of waiting, your program may wish to do something else,
including utilizing the CPU to perform computation or even issuing further I/O requests.
Using threads is a natural way to avoid getting stuck; while one thread in your program
waits (i.e., is blocked waiting for I/O), the CPU scheduler can switch to other threads,
which are ready to run and do something useful. Threading enables overlap of I/O with other
activities within a single program, much like multiprogramming did for processes across
programs; as a result, many modern server-based applications (web servers, database
management systems, and the like) make use of threads in their implementations.
