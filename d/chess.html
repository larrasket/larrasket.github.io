Chess and Brains, scientifically
</p>

</div>


<p>
Several enthusiastic historical practitioners of chess have espoused their
beliefs that the skills associated with chess can be extrapolated to external
scenarios. One of the first documented cases of an intellectual asserting that
connections exist between chess proficiency and other skills is Benjamin
Franklin’s 1750 essay The Morales of Chess. In this essay, Franklin hypothesized
that “The game of Chess is not merely an idle amusement.  Several very valuable
qualities of the mind, useful in the course of human life, are to be acquired or
strengthened by it, so as to become habits, ready on all occasions.” He then
enumerated these specific qualities, listing them as “1. Foresight… 2.
Circumspection… 3.  Caution… [and] lastly… the habit of not being discouraged by
present bad appearances in the state of our affairs.”

<p>
Franklin’s foundation of enumerating the skills cultivated by playing chess
eventually became the groundwork for several academic studies conducted in the
20th and 21st centuries.  These studies, in turn, have helped parents and school
administrators across the world to justify teaching young children chess, in the
hopes of simultaneously improving their cognitive capabilities. Chess education
is a mandatory component of elementary school in Armenia, and local school
districts across United States, Russia, and other nations, have chosen to
incorporate chess into their curricula in order to stimulate the cognitive
skills of children (Milat, 1997).
</p>

<p>
Many studies have been done associating study of chess with heightened
intellectual prowess in school aged children (Ferguson, 1995). Dr. Robert
Ferguson, a researcher with a keen interest in the effects of chess on cognitive
development, compiled and discussed a list of supporting studies in his 1995
research summary Chess in Education. Ferguson discussed numerous studies,
conducted in multiple different nations, during the timeframe 1974 to 1995. Each
study reinforced initial hypotheses that playing chess can potentially
contribute to improved cognitive capabilities outside of the game.
</p>

<p>
The first of the studies discussed by Ferguson took place in Zaire during the
mid 1970s.  Approximately 100 students, aged 16-18, were randomly selected to
either be a part of the treatment or the control group. The treatment group
received two hours of weekly chess instruction over the course of an academic
year, while the control group instead was exposed to two hours of additional
schooling in the default curriculum. Both groups took exams designed to measure
problem solving, verbal, and mathematical skills, both at the beginning of the
year and at the end of the year (Ferguson, 1995).
</p>

<p>
Despite having pretest scores similar to those earned by students in the control
group, students in the treatment group ended up scoring markedly higher than
their control group counterparts on the posttest analysis. This increase in
scores was shown to be statistically significant across the entire treatment
group, and was not just limited to the more skilled chess players. Researchers
used this information to conclude that receiving the one year of chess
instruction led to improved verbal and mathematical aptitudes in test subjects
(Ferguson, 1995). The conclusion that chess proficiency is positively correlated
with cognitive development led to the researchers making the normative claim
that “the introduction of chess as a regular elective course [in schools] would
be of positive benefit.”
</p>

<p>
The results of the Zaire experiment have been supported by the results of a
myriad other trials by other researchers. In an experiment conducted in Belgium
from 1974-1976, researcher Johan Christiaen concluded that the inclusion of
chess lessons in an elementary school classroom facilitated “earlier
intellectual maturation” as defined the experimenters and measured by
standardized examinations (Christiaen, 1977). From 1979-1983, Ferguson conducted
a study in which a treatment group of randomly selected elementary school
children received regular chess instruction in their classrooms. The results of
his study supported his initial hypothesis, and led to the conclusion that
receiving chess instruction generally leads to statistically significant
improvements in both the raw test scores and percentile rankings of students
(Ferguson, 1995).
</p>

<p>
In 2001, Jim Celone conducted a research study in which a small, self-selected,
group of elementary school children received chess instruction over the course
of eight weeks. The study aimed to determine if a correlation exists between
chess proficiency and the ability for children to solve logical thinking
problems both related and unrelated to chess. A comparison of pretest and
posttest results indicated that receiving regular chess instruction led students
to be more adept at solving logical thinking problems in both categories.
Students scored significantly higher on the posttest chess puzzles than they had
on similar pretest chess puzzles, and also made improvements from pretest to
posttest on an examination of logic puzzles that were not based around chess
(Celone, 2001).
</p>

<p>
In addition to these various studies, which have documented a positive
correlation between chess proficiency and scores on standardized examinations,
several studies have associated chess playing with improvement in other
cognitive traits, such as memory, creativity, critical thinking, and originality
(Ferguson, 1995). While many studies have demonstrated that chess can be
effectively used as a tool to facilitate improvement on standardized
examinations, admittedly fewer studies have examined the correlation between
chess proficiency and otherwise unrelated intellectual pursuits.
</p>

<p>
One study, conducted by Philip Rifner from 1991-1992, aimed to determine whether
or not students who practiced general problem solving skills through playing
chess could successfully apply those skills to an unrelated domain, in this
case, poetic analysis. The study concluded that chess proficiency develops
skills which students can indeed apply to other fields. Students were shown to
be more adept at poetic analysis as a result of exposure to chess, leading to
the conclusion that chess potentially accelerates cognitive development in a
multitude of capacities (Rifner, 1992).
</p>

<p>
Due to the widespread acknowledgement of the intellectual benefits associated
with playing chess, initiatives have been undertaken across the globe to
incorporate the game into school curricula. In the United States, the initiative
has been spearheaded by the American Chess Foundation (ACF) and the United
States Chess Federation (USCF) (Milat, 1997). One specific initiative, based in
New Jersey, officially sanctioned the use of chess as an educational tool in
elementary schools, declaring that “instruction in chess during the second grade
will enable pupils to learn skills which will serve them throughout their
lives.” Similar efforts to incorporate chess into school curricula have taken
place in nations as diverse as Russia, Venezuela, and Armenia. The legislative
bodies responsible for these initiatives have officially stated their beliefs
that learning chess helps students develop cognitive skills which are directly
applicable to their external lives.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, research into skills enhanced by chess proficiency typically
focuses on case studies of elementary school, middle school, and high school
aged children. There is a glaring lack of research into the impacts of chess
proficiency on the capabilities of adults to succeed in external endeavors.
President Truman famously compared international politics to a game of chess,
referencing inherent similarities between the two subject matters, specifically
the need for strategic decision making in a competitive environment (Truman,
1947). Because studies have shown that children have the capacity to apply
skills honed by chess proficiency to external domains, it is not entirely
unreasonable to hypothesize that adults who regularly play chess will also be
able to apply techniques of strategic decision making to their personal
endeavors, giving them a competitive edge over those adults who do not play
chess (Rifner, 1992, Van Zyl, 1991).
