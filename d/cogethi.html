<p>
For a background, I posted this on account recently:
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Let \(\varphi\) be a universal ethical model where \(\varphi(x) = -1\) means that \(x\) is an
unethical action.  Let person \(Y\) be someone who does the behavior \(M\) in daily basis
where \(\varphi(M)=-1\). \(Y\) acknowledges \(M\) as a bad behavior but he/she does not have the
will power to retrain from it and he/she lives with this inconsistency and accepts to live
in shame with these actions. Let person \(Z\), in the contrary, not acknowledging
\(\varphi(M)=-1\) based on his/her own philosophy of \(\varphi\), thus, he/she does \(M\) freely
without an inconsistency in his/her life, without shame. Do note that Z might be inclined
to his/her POV of o just for the fact that he/she indeed likes doing \(M\). Which person
possess a better lifestyle and understanding?
</p>

</blockquote></div>


<p>
So:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(Y\) acknowledges \(\varphi(M) = -1\), thus experiencing \(\lambda = \text{shame}\).</li>
<li>\(Z\) does not acknowledge \(\varphi(M) = -1\), thus devoid of \(\lambda\).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Also let:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>\(\Lambda(Y) = \lambda\) represent shame,</li>
<li>\(\Lambda(Z) = 0\) represent no shame,</li>
</ul>

<p>
So we have:  \(\Lambda(Y) = \lambda \quad \text{iff} \quad \varphi(M) = -1\) and  \(\Lambda(Z) = 0 \quad \text{iff} \quad \varphi'(M) \neq -1\)
</p>

<p>
(for the sake of simplicity I will use male pronouns for Z and Y)
</p>

<p>
Here&rsquo;s my own view. \(Y\) is a self-flagellating ascetic, and \(Z\) is liberated: person \(Y\), is
ensnared within a cruel dichotomy. He is consciously aware of the moral infraction he
commits and that his actions are steeped in unethical mire, inducing a wretched cycle of
shame. Knowing full well the chains that bind him, he lacks the  will to snap these links.
He lives, therefore, in antagonizing dissonance—a sad harmony of recognition and
helplessness. Instead of succumbing to external judgment, \(Z\) uses \(\varphi'\), an
individualized ethical model based on personal philosophy and existential authenticity.
</p>

<p>
\(Z\) is crafting and adhering to self-determined values rather than the prescribed
dictates of the herd. This is not mere ignorance or blissful disconnection; it is active
revaluation (Umwertung aller Werte)— the reevaluation of all values, a courageous endeavor
to reconstruct the moral landscape based on self-sovereignty.
While \(Y\) grapples with \(\lambda\)—a product of subjugation to the external ethical
model—\(Z\) lives in radical freedom. His ethical stance, albeit perceived as transgressive
by \(\varphi\), is an authentic expression of his will to power. <a href="../h/n.html#loqfv5p02wj0">Nietzsche</a> placed supreme
value on the creation of one’s own values, an act requiring immense courage and
intellectual vigor.
</p>

<p>
\(Y\)&rsquo;s struggle, though seemingly noble, is secondary to the transformative potency of
\(Z\)&rsquo;s path. What \(Z\)&rsquo;s lifestyle looks to me would be:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Creation of new values by not acknowledging \(\varphi(M) = -1\), \(Z\) challenges the
established norms and creates new values indicative of his inner autonomy;</li>
<li>More importantly, authenticity, \(Z\)’s behavior aligns with his intrinsic nature</li>
</ul>

<p>
Will to power. \(Z\)’s rejection of \(\lambda\) and the traditional moral construct is a
testament to his will to power. \(Z\) does not agree to live in shame, and hopefully he is
rational, thus his view of what \(\varphi'\) is like is much more consistent which means
that he does not agree to what goes out of that model. We can not infer \(Z\) to hedonism,
because, unless being irrational, the model \(\varphi'\) will never be fit for all what he
considers as a pleasure.<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
As of writing that, I think there&rsquo;s an issue with that argument,
as it depends on Z&rsquo;s rationality and it falls apart without it. I might have to update
that later
