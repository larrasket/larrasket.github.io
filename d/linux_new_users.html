How I do X on Linux?
</p>

</div>



<p>
I thought I wa not not going to use this short posts page to write anything
technical, but I think being a &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_user">power user</a>&rdquo; does not have anything with writing
about shit software engineering topics. Anyway, I think I know a fundamental
issue new Linux users face, that&rsquo;s not really focused on, it is the
understanding of different layers/level of their operating system. This issue is
almost unidentifiable in the other operating systems&rsquo; communities, although it&rsquo;s
there. An example that I&rsquo;ve personally seen was asking this question, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a
DELL laptop, how can I fix this issue with X software?&rdquo;. The question has an
unrelated detail that reflects an uncomprehending state of whatever they are
using, they should probably ask how do I fix that on Windows 7 or whatever. Most
of the time people who try to help deduce whatever OS or platform they are
talking about (mostly from the X), so it is not really a problem on these
platforms. However, with Linux, it does really matter especially that the
situation on Linux scarce when it comes to packaging everything. Ubuntu is
probably the only Linux distribution that gets the best out of that, for example
let&rsquo;s assume that question: how to fix the ugly terminal font in my Ubuntu
laptop? well just open gnome settings and change it from there. Once you knew
that whoever is asking is an Ubuntu user you know for sure that they are using
gnome terminal.
</p>

<p>
Now let&rsquo;s assume that there&rsquo;s a new Linux user who is looking on how to install
Java or Python, they might find an official step from Oracle or Python websites
to do something like this:
</p>

<pre class="example" id="orgd21335b">
 tar xvf Python-3.2.8.tgz
 cd Python-3.2.8
 ./configure --prefix=/opt/python
 make
 sudo make install
</pre>

<p>
Which is perfectly fine for a Linux power user, sometimes, but for a newbie it
might cause a lot of troubles especially when they download another package
from their package manager that might depend on Python (inb4 the package manager
finds some files occupying the python installation location and refuses to
proceed). Or they actually might just break their system while trying to resolve
some issues in the <code>make install</code> error message. A friend of mine was about to
go in this loop while trying to install yt-dlp a while ago, while following a
tutorial of how to do that on Linux.
</p>

<p>
[an important side note here, the importance of asking the question the right
way is not about of us, the people who might help, get their job done quicker,
but for the users to understand what they are looking for, so they might not
even have to ask]
</p>

<p>
Now there&rsquo;s no really a straightforward way to make newbies learn how to ask the
question in the correct way since appending what distribution they are using is
not really helpful always: how can I fix the terrible font on Manjaro? because
this barely gives enough information, yet it&rsquo;s better than &ldquo;how I fix it on
Linux&rdquo; because there are many possible variables on that, like the desktop
environment, the window manager, the composer, etc.. unlike Ubuntu, you can not
deduce all of that at once.

<p>
I believe that the easier way to resolve this issue on Linux is that for
distribution maintainers to provide a simple way to educate users about not only
the layers of their operating system but what is each layer responsible for. This
way not only they can learn what to ask about, but how to customize everything
as they want.
