And why this blog does not provide RSS/Atom feeds or notification updates?

<h2 id="org6d0887c">Why this site does not provide RSS/Atom feeds or notification updates?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org6d0887c">
<p>
Because it should not, and if you care about such a thing like 'being notified' about each
new entry so you can make sure that you will never miss a beat to consume the wisdom, fun,
tech stuff or whatever you believe this blog to provide you with, that you want to make the
best of each entry here, then those entries aren't probably written for you.
</p>

<p>
There are two main reasons for that, the first one is that I wrote this blog with intention,
as Nietzsche describes: (and I quote this a lot, it's one of my favorite preachings of his):
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A DIGRESSION.—[..] This is not intended to be read through at once, or to be read aloud. It
is intended more particularly for reference, especially on our walks and travels: we must
take it up and put it down again after a short reading, and, more especially, we ought not
to be amongst our usual surroundings.<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
توقفٌ- هذا لم يكتب ليقرأ من البداية للنهاية بسرعة، ولا أن يقرأ بصوتٍ مسموع؛ على القارئ أن يفتحه
أغلب الوقت، خاصة وهو يتفسح أو وهو مسافر؛ يجب أن يستطيع الغوص إلى أعماقه، ثم ينظر حوله فلا يرى
شيئًا مألوفًا.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Most importantly; I do see an issue in looking forward for the consumption of content, such
willingness is not regular for poise and self-realization. This place should never be a
place of interest for anyone.

For the digitally youngers of you who weren't there in the era of google reader and the
assumptive dependency of RSS XML feed readers; you can check <a href="https://www.d.umn.edu/itss/training/online/webdesign/rss.html">this page</a> to learn more about
it. Basically it was none-bullshit way to get feed updates: instead of reloading the BBC
homepage every 10 minutes to check for news, you simply follow the XML feeds that they provide.
</p>

<p>
Why people stopped doing this? It is not clear to be frank. But I anticipate that this is
related to Google killing Google Reader; obviously many stupid people (i.e. the majority of
who live with us in the planet) assumed that it means that there is no RSS anymore.
Nonetheless, I think that it has to do much with social media platforms, since you can just
follow the BBC page by hitting a button, and get the news feed mixed with your friends edgy
internet posts.
</p>

<p>
However, this led to a bigger problem. Bigger than what? Well, there is a main problem, you
see; the BBC is just a mean of propaganda, if you would depend on such a resource, you
already committed your first blunder<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>; although back then people used to have multiple
RSS provider (let's say AP and BBC).
</p>

<p>
The thing with RSS/Atom feeds, is that it can't be centralized, controlled, filtered because
it's a very basic and minimal technology, it's up to your feed reader to do all of this (if
it would, and even in the case of Google Reader, a corporate-based reader, it wouldn't). The
reader is the only centralized piece in this pipeline and it's not probably controlled<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
What people went to, on the other hand, is using not just a centralized; but a
mind-washing-based, correctness-oriented mind-engineering platforms to sort, choose,
recommend the news feeds for them.
</p>

</figure>


<p>
Using this method establish a new set of means of mind controlling (beyond that one that
excited before). I'm taking an advantage of the fact that most readers of this blog know
already about the incident that exposed how social media platforms are used to manipulate
the public's mind.
</p>

<p>
In fine, even if you are satisfied with propagandized content from top publishers like the
BBC and F*ance24, do not fetch them through another mind controlling set.
</p>

<p>
So, what to do about that? Thankfully 99% of websites and news providers still have XML
entries (even if they don't use/know about it, for instance, all wordpress sites generate
rss routes automatically), you can just pick a proper RSS/Atom reader and use it.
</p>

<p>
Remember, whoever controls the media controls your minds;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>"Propaganda is major component in all power systems, both secular and
religious; false propaganda is a major component of unprincipled power systems.
All power systems endeavor to convince their subjects that the system is good,
just, beneficent and noble, as well as worthy of perpetuation and defense. The
more jingoistic propaganda issued, the more suspicious one should be of its truth."</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Of course, the way that social media choose you feeds (and sort them) is not always about
what the juice lobby paid them to do for them, the but most of the time it is
profit-oriented, which can be either unhealthy (in some hows) or unuseful as expected (like
not getting the educative feeds that you are waiting for from some video creator, instead
you get consumable content of trendy/sexualized content<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>). For most people, getting
weaned from social media addiction and basically removing these malware from your life can
be more effective.
